In the event of a disk failure, the data is still available on the other disks. RAID 0, 4, and 5 do not mirror the data but instead use striping, which involves breaking up the data into segments that are then stored across different disks. RAID 0 provides no redundancy, RAID 4 stores parity information on a dedicated disk, and RAID 5 distributes the parity information across all the disks.",

Software developers use two techniques to prevent this from happening: using the new configuration file called .rpmnew and leaving the original file intact or saving the old configuration as .rpmsave and replacing the original. In both cases, the administrator can review the original and new configurations to determine what settings will be used on the system.",

        "questionText":  "Which of these are common measures that Linux system administrators take to make a system more secure?",
        "explanation":  "Setting default permissions is a strategy to ensure that a permission baseline is maintained when new files and directories are created, and the umask command is used for this purpose. Disabling or removing insecure services is also a common strategy (for example, removing Telnet and strictly using SSH). Enforcing password policies to ensure minimum password strength and forcing users to change passwords at regular intervals and disabling password reuse are all good strategies to help maintain system security. A system administrator needs to ensure that a software package is up to date and properly configured in order to keep the system secured, and removing unused packages is a good strategy to reduce time spent configuring and auditing to maintain system security. This list is by no means exhaustive.",

Next, the system executes the /etc/bash.bashrc initialization file; on most Linux platforms, this script includes code that executes all the initialization files in the /etc/profile.d directory that end in .sh. This is where system administrators can put code that will execute every time the user opens a new shell.",

When a multi-container pod is deployed, a sidecar is required, although it does not necessarily have to be an Ambassador sidecar container.",

        "explanation":  "Checking the log files on the system might provide insight into the problem; for example, the /var/log/secure log often contain entries that describe why an attempt failed. Having the user provide the failed command output might reveal that the user is issuing the command incorrectly, and the error output may assist with determining the cause of the problem. Reviewing the configuration file for the tool being used may show that a service is misconfigured or not configured to perform what the user is trying to do. Checking the PAM configuration may show that PAM is blocking the privilege elevation. These steps are not exhaustive but provide a good starting point when troubleshooting privilege elevation issues.",
