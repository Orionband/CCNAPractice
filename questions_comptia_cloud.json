This reduces the need for human interaction also reducing the likelihood of human error as well as facilitating version control and collaboration. IaC does not eliminate scripting but rather relies on it, and it enhances the need for version control.",

        "explanation":  "Rehosting, often referred to as \u0026quot;lift and shift,\u0026quot; involves moving applications to the cloud with minimal or no changes to the existing codebase. This strategy is typically faster and less complex compared to replatforming or rearchitecting. Replatforming may involve some optimizations, while rearchitecting and refactoring require significant code modifications.",

REST supports various formats like JSON, XML, and others, offering flexibility. RPC focuses on invoking remote procedures without being tied to XML. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for APIs designed for retrieving data in a flexible and efficient manner.",
