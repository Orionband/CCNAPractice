        "explanation":  "Hactivists seek to promote social change; they believe that defacing websites and hacking servers is acceptable as long as it promotes their goals. Regardless of their motives, hacking remains illegal, and they are subject to the same computer crime laws as any other criminal. The other answers are incorrect. Ethical hackers work within the boundaries of laws and ethics. Gray hat hackers are individuals who cross the line between legal and questionable behavior. Black hat hackers are criminal hackers and might be motivated to perform illegal activities for many different reasons.",

In a differential backup model, a full backup is typically done once a week, and a daily differential backup copies all files that have changed since the last full backup. If you need to restore, you need the last full backup and the most recent differential backup. All other answers are incorrect. All three differentials are not needed. Only the full backup will not provide you with the most recent changes. Using only the differentials will not provide all the needed backup data.",

All three incrementals are needed because they only capture files that have changed since the previous full backup or previous incremental backup are backed up each day. Using just the full backup or only the last incremental will not enable you to restore all your data.",

        "explanation":  "DNS Footprinting involves gathering information about a target by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for details such as domain names, IP addresses, and network infrastructure information. To mitigate the risks associated with DNS Footprinting, organizations can implement DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions). DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that adds cryptographic authentication and integrity verification to DNS responses, helping to prevent DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and other DNS-related attacks.",

        "explanation":  "Port scanning is one of the most popular techniques that penetration testers and hackers use to determine what ports and services are running. An XMAS scan sets the FIN, URG, and PSH flags on. Open ports should provide no response. Closed ports should return an RST. Systems must be designed per RFC 793. All other answers are incorrect. A NULL scan sends a TCP packet with no flags set. An IDLE scan spoofs packets from an idle host while examining the IP ID. An ACK scan sets the ACK flag and is typically used to look for stateless firewalls.",

Port 26 is sometimes used as an alternative SMTP port for clients or servers that are unable to use port 25 due to network restrictions or ISP limitations. It\u0026#39;s not as widely used as port 25 for SMTP communication. Port 53 is the default port used for DNS services, which is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. It is not associated with SMTP communication. Port 161 is the default port used for SNMP, which is used for monitoring and managing network devices such as routers, switches, and servers. It is not associated with SMTP communication.",

        "explanation":  "The -D decoy switch is used to evade an IDS or firewall. The idea is to make it appear to the target that the decoys are the source of the scan, which obscures the real source of the attacker. Decoy can be used two ways. The first is with the RND option so that nmap generates a random set of source IP addresses. The second is that the attacker can specify a specific list of spoofed source addresses.",

This command is used in the same way as the HELO command.\n\tSTARTTLS: Used to start a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection to an email server.\n\tRCPT: Used to denote the email address of the recipient.\n\tDATA: Used to initiate the transfer of the contents of an email message.\n\tRSET: Used to reset (cancel) an email transaction.\n\tMAIL: Used to denote the email address of the sender.\n\tQUIT: Used to close a connection.\n\tHELP: Used to display a help menu (if available).\n\tAUTH: Used to authenticate a client to the server.\n\tVRFY: Used to verify whether a user\u0026rsquo;s email mailbox exists.\n\tEXPN: Used to request, or expand, a mailing list on the remote server.",

        "questionText":  "You have gained access to a system and would now like to hide a file that will be hidden and streamed behind another. Which of the following file systems is required?",
        "explanation":  "NTFS (New Technology File System) is the file system that supports alternate data streams (ADS), allowing files to be hidden and streamed behind another file. ADS is a feature of NTFS that enables additional data to be associated with a file or folder without altering its size or functionality visibly. Therefore, NTFS is required to hide a file behind another in this manner.",

These passwords are a maximum of 14 characters and store the password in two 7-character fields. The other answers are incorrect because NTLMv1, NTLMv2, and Kerberos are all more secure than LM.",

An overwriting virus overwrites existing data with its own code. A multipartite virus combines characteristics of multiple virus types, such as infecting both executable files and boot sectors. Multipartite viruses can be challenging to detect and remove because of their ability to infect different parts of a system.",

In this scenario, the company wants to assess its internal network security without disrupting operations. Gray-box testing allows the assessment team to have partial knowledge of the internal network infrastructure, such as network diagrams or system configurations, while still simulating real-world attack scenarios. This approach provides a balanced assessment of security vulnerabilities without requiring full access to sensitive information (white-box) or operating blindly (black-box). Therefore, gray-box testing is the most suitable option for this scenario.",

        "explanation":  "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are specifically designed to monitor system behavior in real-time and detect anomalous activities indicative of fileless malware attacks. By analyzing process execution, memory usage, and other behavioral indicators, EDR solutions can identify suspicious patterns and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of fileless malware. This approach is more effective than traditional antivirus software, which may struggle to detect fileless malware due to its reliance on signature-based detection methods. While implementing network segmentation can be an effective strategy for limiting the spread of malware within a network, it may not be the most effective approach for detecting and mitigating fileless malware attacks. Fileless malware attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in endpoint systems and operate within the memory or legitimate system processes, making them less reliant on network communication for propagation. Similarly, while conducting periodic vulnerability assessments and patch management is essential for maintaining overall security, it may not be the most effective strategy for detecting and mitigating fileless malware attacks. Fileless malware often leverages zero-day vulnerabilities or exploits existing vulnerabilities in legitimate system processes or applications, making them difficult to detect and mitigate through traditional vulnerability assessments.",

        "explanation":  "ARP cache poisoning involves sending phony ARP requests or replies to the switch and other devices to attempt to steer traffic to the sniffing system. Bogus ARP packets will be stored by the switch and by the other devices that receive the packets. The switch and these devices will place this information into the ARP cache and then map the attacker to the spoofed device. All the other answers are incorrect. Flooding overloads the switch with random MAC addresses and enables the attacker to then sniff traffic that might not otherwise be visible. The concept behind a rogue DHCP server starts with a starvation attack designed to exhaust all possible IP addresses that are available from the DHCP server. First, the attacker will use up all available DHCP addresses. When the legitimate DHCP server is without available IP addresses to issue, the attacker can start up his own rogue DHCP server with the gateway reflecting his own IP address. That then forces all traffic to be routed via the hacker. This enables interception of data. MAC spoofing is the act of changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. If only specific MAC addresses are permitted, this can enable the attacker to gain access to a network.",

        "explanation":  "In a replay attack, an attacker intercepts and retransmits data packets that were previously recorded, aiming to impersonate a legitimate user or gain unauthorized access to a system. By repeatedly sending the same data packets at regular intervals, the attacker attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the system\u0026#39;s authentication or authorization mechanisms. Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks involve an attacker intercepting and possibly altering communication between two parties, SQL injection attacks manipulate SQL queries to access or modify data in a database, and DDoS attacks flood a server or network with a large volume of traffic to disrupt services.",

The other answers are incorrect because disabling zone transfers or blocking TCP 53, which is the port and protocol used for zone transfers, cannot stop spoofing. Disabling DNS timeouts also would not help because it would only cause the spoofing to persist.",

        "explanation":  "Many web servers use a custom algorithm or predefined pattern to generate session IDs. The greater the predictability of a session token, the weaker it is and the easier it is to predict. If an attacker can capture several IDs and analyze the pattern, they might be able to predict the session token ID. When the pattern is identified, the attacker can simply inject the predicted ID to gain access. All other answers are incorrect. A man-in-the-browser attack is similar to an on-path attack, but the attacker must first infect the victim\u0026rsquo;s computer with a Trojan. The attacker usually gets the malware onto the victim\u0026rsquo;s computer through some form of trickery or deceit. Session fixation uses a fixed session ID. Session replay attacks enable an attacker to pretend to be an authorized user on an interactive website. The attack is made possible by stealing the user\u0026rsquo;s session ID; the intruder gains access and the ability to do anything the authorized user can do on the website. The attacker captures the authentication token and then replays it back to the server to gain access",

To get around this limitation, switch manufacturers have developed a solution known as port mirroring or, on Cisco switches, Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN). Port mirroring is used to attach IDSs and sniffers such as Wireshark. All other answers are incorrect. DHCP snooping works with information from a DHCP server to track the physical location of hosts, ensure that hosts use only the IP addresses assigned to them, and ensure that only authorized DHCP servers are accessible. EtherFlood floods a switched network with Ethernet frames with random hardware addresses. The effect on some switches is that they start sending traffic out on all ports so that you can sniff all the traffic on the network. Port security limits the number of MAC addresses on the port. Port security can also limit by specific MAC addresses.",

        "explanation":  "Port security limits the number of MAC addresses on the port and can also limit access based on specific MAC addresses. All other answers are incorrect. DHCP snooping works with information from a DHCP server to track the physical location of hosts, ensure that hosts use only the IP addresses assigned to them, and ensure that only authorized DHCP servers are accessible. EtherFlood floods a switched network with ethernet frames with random hardware addresses. The effect on some switches is that they start sending traffic out on all ports, letting you sniff all the network traffic. Switches segment traffic so that it is no longer possible to monitor all the traffic by attaching a promiscuous mode device to a single port. Port mirroring and Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) are solutions developed by switch manufacturers to get around this limitation.",

Port security is a feature used to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed to access a switch port and does not directly defend against ARP poisoning. DHCP snooping is a security feature used to mitigate DHCP-related attacks and does not directly address ARP poisoning.",

ARP poisoning involves manipulating the ARP cache of devices on the network by sending fake ARP messages, allowing the attacker to intercept and redirect network traffic to their own machine. This technique enables the attacker to bypass the switching mechanism and capture traffic intended for other devices on the network.",

The local-area network is fully switched and sits behind a NATing router and a firewall. Which of the following techniques would work best?",
        "explanation":  "ARP spoofing is used to redirect traffic on a switched network. Setting the MAC address to be the same as his coworker\u0026rsquo;s would not be effective. DNS spoofing would not help in this situation because DNS resolves FQDNs to unknown IP addresses. ARP poisoning requires a hacker to set the MAC address to be the same as the default gateway, not the IP address.",

        "explanation":  "XSRF (or CSRF, cross-site request forgery) is an attack that works by means of third-party redirect of static content, in that unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts. This attack is completely carried out from an attacker-influenced site against the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser and from the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser against the target site. All other answers are incorrect. A race condition attack exploits the time difference between when something is written to memory and when it is used. If the attacker can access that location in memory after the data is written but before it is used, they might be able to tamper with the value. SQL injection is possible because of vulnerabilities in the web application. SQL servers are primarily vulnerable because of the lack of user input sanitization. XSS (cross-site scripting) uses a web application to send malicious code to an end user. XSS exploits vulnerabilities in dynamically generated web pages.",

Creating multiple user accounts with elevated privileges could potentially provide the attacker with additional access to the system, but it does not directly address the need for persistence. Additionally, this action could increase the likelihood of detection by administrators. Modifying log files to erase evidence of unauthorized access may temporarily conceal the attacker\u0026#39;s activities, but it would not ensure long-term access to the system. Furthermore, tampering with log files is likely to raise suspicion and prompt further investigation.",

        "explanation":  "While WPA3 provides strong encryption for wireless networks, it only secures the data transmitted between devices and the access point. However, HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the web server and client devices, providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access, even if the WPA3 password is compromised. The other choices are incorrect. Using HTTP instead of HTTPS leaves the data transmitted between the web server and client devices vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. Longer email passwords and multifactor authentication could enhance user authentication processes but do not directly enhance the security of wireless network communications.",

        "explanation":  "Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was developed as an interim solution to address the vulnerabilities and weaknesses found in the original Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol. It delivers a level of security way beyond what WEP offers. WPA uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which uses a hashing algorithm and adds an integrity-checking feature verifying that the keys haven\u0026rsquo;t been tampered with. WPA improved on WEP by increasing the IV from 24 bits to 48. WPA eliminated rollover, which means that key reuse is less likely to occur. WPA also avoids another weakness of WEP by using a different secret key for each packet. Another improvement in WPA is message integrity. All other answers are incorrect.",

This technique provides resistance to interference and eavesdropping. All other answers are incorrect. Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) divides a signal into small pieces for transmission, spreading the signal across a broader bandwidth to make it more resistant to interference and jamming. Plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) is a technology used in telecommunications networks to transport large quantities of data over digital transport equipment such as fiber-optic cable. Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is used in circuit-switched networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Multiple signals are transmitted over the same communication channel by allocating each signal a specific time slot.",

        "explanation":  "Code signing is a common security feature in iOS devices that restricts the installation of apps from sources other than the official App Store by verifying the integrity and authenticity of the app\u0026#39;s code. Jailbreaking refers to removing software restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operating system on a device. This lets the user gain access to features and functionalities that are otherwise restricted, such as installing unauthorized apps or customizing the device\u0026#39;s operating system. Rooting is similar to jailbreaking but is specific to Android devices. It involves gaining root access or administrative privileges on the Android operating system. App sandboxing is a security mechanism used in operating systems, particularly mobile operating systems like iOS and Android. It isolates individual applications from each other and from the rest of the system, preventing them from accessing data or resources that they are not explicitly authorized to use. Sandboxing also enhances security by containing potential threats within the confines of each application\u0026#39;s sandbox.",

Hackers transmit unauthorized commands by riding an active session by using an email or malicious link to trick users while they are currently logged into a cloud service. A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is used to steal cookies that can be exploited to gain access as an authenticated user to a cloud-based service.

Serverless platforms abstract away the underlying infrastructure, which means users have less control over configuring security settings at the runtime level. This limitation can pose security risks if not properly managed, as misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities. While some other answer choices involve genuine security concerns in cloud environments or data center operations, they are not specific to serverless computing.",

        "explanation":  "Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It provides a distributed system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of machines and offers features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates. Kubernetes natively supports launching containers with Docker and AppC images, making it a popular choice for container orchestration in cloud-native environments. Apache Mesos is another container orchestration platform, but it is not specifically designed for container management like Kubernetes. Debian Linux and Ubuntu Linux are popular Linux distributions but are not container orchestration platforms.",

        "explanation":  "Serverless is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and so on) dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. The server option refers to traditional server-based computing, which involves the user or organization managing the servers themselves rather than relying on dynamic allocation and provisioning by a cloud provider. While the term cloud managed implies management by the cloud provider, it does not specifically indicate dynamic allocation and provisioning of servers, which is a characteristic of serverless computing. Virtual broker computing is not a term associated with cloud computing execution models.",

Securely backing up all data stored in the compromised cloud storage bucket would be a good practice, but not an immediate preventive measure to stop future unauthorized access.

It suggests reverting to older technology instead of addressing security concerns directly. Relying solely on the cloud service provider\u0026#39;s built-in security features wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be sufficient. Security is a shared responsibility between the customer and provider. Allowing unrestricted outbound network traffic from serverless functions would compromise security by potentially exposing sensitive data or resources to unauthorized access or malicious activities.

        "explanation":  "In the test stage, automated tests are run to validate the code and the application behavior. The test stage acts as a safety net to prevent easily reproducible bugs from being introduced. While automated testing is also a part of the development stage, the primary focus is writing and coding the software. The deployment stage involves releasing the software to production environments. Automated tests are typically run before this stage to ensure the stability of the code. The editing stage generally refers to the process of modifying or refining code or documentation. While testing may be part of the editing process, it\u0026#39;s not the primary focus. Automated tests are typically run separately from this stage.",

        "explanation":  "Cipher-text only attacks require a hacker to obtain encrypted messages that have been encrypted using the same encryption algorithm. For example, the original version of WEP used RC4 and, if sniffed for long enough, the repetitions would enable a hacker to extract the WEP key. All the other answers are incorrect. The purpose of steganography is that messages can be hidden in images, sound files, videos, or even the whitespace of a document before it\u0026rsquo;s sent. Common steganography techniques include substitution, cover generation, distortion, statistical, spread spectrum, and transform domain. Known plain-text attacks require the hacker to have both the plain text and cipher text of one or more messages. Together, the two items can be used to extract the cryptographic key and recover the remaining encrypted zipped files. Side-channel attacks occur when an attacker can observe some issues about the system itself, such as timing, power consumption, size, or noise. This form of attack is not related to traditional attacks such as replay or brute force.",

        "explanation":  "Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, works best at key exchange and key management. It allows for secure exchange of keys between parties without the need for a pre-established shared secret. The other answers are incorrect. Symmetric encryption works well with bulk encryption, but key management and key exchange can be a drawback. There must be a secure method in which to transfer keys. Digital signatures are used for authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation. They are much like signatures in real life because they validate the integrity of documents and senders. In the context of key management, hashing algorithms may be used to derive keys from passwords or other secret values, but they are not directly involved in key exchange mechanisms like asymmetric encryption.",

        "explanation":  "IPsec can be used in tunnel mode or transport mode. Transport mode provides a secure connection between two endpoints by encapsulating IP\u0026rsquo;s payload, whereas tunnel mode provides an even more secure connection by encapsulating the entire IP packet. OSPF mode is not an IPsec mode. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol used for dynamically finding the best path for data packets. VPN (Virtual Private Network) extends a private network across a public network.",
