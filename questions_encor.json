        "explanation":  "A host listens for Ethernet frames that have a destination MAC address equal to the MAC address of the host\u0026rsquo;s NIC. A host also listens for Ethernet frames that use a broadcast destination MAC address, which is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. A frame that contains a destination MAC address that is not the broadcast address and that is not assigned to Host A will not be processed.",

        "explanation":  "Certain Cisco Catalyst switching platforms, such as the Catalyst 9300, use an SDM template to carve out resources. This allows the switch\u0026rsquo;s or stack\u0026rsquo;s hardware resources to be tailored to the type of role the device is performing. For example, the default SDM template is the Advanced template, which provides support for additional QoS and policy-based routing capacity. If these features are not required, additional VLAN resources can be used with the VLAN SDM template. If operating in a stack, all switches must use the same SDM template.",

Since Host A and Host B are connected to different ports on Switch 1, they are not in the same collision domain. Since all ports on Switch 1 belong to VLAN 10, Switch 1 will forward any Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address to all ports. Therefore, all ports on Switch 1 belong to the same broadcast domain. Broadcasts are not propagated by Layer 3 routers. Since Host A and Host B belong to the same VLAN and the same IP subnet, they can communicate directly at Layer 2 without the need for a Layer 3 router.",

        "explanation":  "A switch that detects a topology change on a non-edge port sends BPDUs with the TC flag set for the duration of the TC while timer (hello timer * 2). MAC addresses associated with these ports are flushed. This occurs on all designated ports (DPs) and the root port (RP). Neighboring switches that receive the BPDU with the TC flag set clear the MAC table entries associated with all ports except the port that received the BPDU. The TC while timer is started on all DPs and the RP, and BPDUs are sent during this time with the TC flag set. This process continues until the change is propagated across the network. Unlike 802.1D, RSTP does not rely on the root bridge to send a specific TCN BPDU.",

The superior switch receives the acknowledgment and also transitions its port to forwarding state as a designated port.",

        "explanation":  "The STP portfast feature is typically enabled on edge ports that are connected directly to end hosts, where the possibility of forming a loop does not exist. It can be combined with BPDU Guard to put a port in the ErrDisabled state if a switch is connected to the port. Edge ports do not generate TCNs to provide a more stable spanning tree environment. A TCN based on an edge port change would not bring any benefit since the overall spanning tree topology should not change. It is possible to enable portfast on a trunk port (for instance, connected to a firewall or server that needs to receive 802.1Q tags) and also meets the requirement as an edge port.",

If the global configuration command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default is used, the port sends a series of BPDUs to see if any are received back. If it is the more preferred switch, it does not process any received BPDUs but still transmits BPDUs. If it is not the preferred switch, it processes received BPDUs and ceases to send BPDUs on the port. BPDU filter should be used with caution as it may allow forwarding loops to occur.",

EtherChannel provides multiple benefits, including allowing multiple physical interfaces to be combined into a single logical bundle. This can not only increase bandwidth, but the EtherChannel is a single interface in the spanning tree topology. Thus, a single member link can go down without requiring a spanning tree topology change. Another benefit is that frames are load balanced across the member links, based on a configurable EtherChannel load balancing hash mechanism.",

Transit traffic across the link will have the greatest chance of providing a different link-hash result due to the changing src/dst IP address pairs of the packets. All the other options would result in some form of link polarization because the algorithm would only be considering inputs that would remain the same; for example, dst-mac would always be the same between two routers.",

Because PBR does not change the RIB, troubleshooting can become complicated as the routing table displays the next-hop address learned from the routing protocol but does not display a different next-hop address for the conditional traffic. PBR is not a routing protocol that requires neighbors to support PBR.",

Additional next-hop addresses can be configured so that the secondary next-hop addresses can be used if the first next-hop address is not in the Routing Information Base (RIB).

        "explanation":  "Each source protocol uses its own defined metrics to determine the best route to install in the RIB. The RIB uses administrative distance to compare the routes provided by different source protocols. Protocols with a lower number are preferred routes in the RIB, and the router uses the RIB locally to determine the preference of each protocol. When forwarding traffic, a longest prefix match route is used, regardless of the administrative distance of the source protocol. A /32 route installed by iBGP is preferred over a /24 static route, for example.",

        "explanation":  "When a router is forwarding traffic, a lookup in the RIB is performed for the destination address. The primary factor in deciding which route to use is the route that matches the destination most specifically. In other words, the route with the longest prefix match is always preferred. The RIB uses administrative distance to choose routes for the same destination but from different protocols. In this example, OSPF is installing both the /28 and /26 networks into the RIB because they represent different destination networks. If OSPF had a metric 16 and a metric 20 path to the same network, only the metric 16 path would be installed in the RIB.",

        "explanation":  "EIGRP can use classic/narrow metrics or wide metrics. Wide metrics were developed to allow path differentiation with ever-increasing bandwidth and decreasing delay values on high-speed interfaces such as 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, and greater. The two styles of metrics are interoperable and backward compatible. By default, EIGRP uses the minimum bandwidth and cumulative delay to calculate its composite metric for a destination.",

        "explanation":  "OSPF uses a reliable flooding mechanism to exchange database entries between neighbors. If these packets are lost, OSPF tears down the adjacency after 25 failed attempts. In this scenario, SW1 is likely dropping the DBD packets. Another possibility is that if the MTU is larger on R1 and R2 than SW1, SW1 could drop large DBD packets due to MTU failure.

If there are only two routers, what the reader describes is true, because resetting the process on the BDR will restart the election process between the only two participants. If there are more than two routers the behavior may change depending on which device has its process reset. The most reliable method is still the correct answer listed\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This will remove the current DR, the BDR will take over as DR and a new BDR may be selected.

        "explanation":  "By far the most common OSPF network types are point-to-point and broadcast. If more than two devices are connected to a segment, then a DR is required. Thus, for those interfaces, broadcast is usually used. For true point-to-point interfaces, such as serial, tunnel, or port channel, there are only two routers, which eliminates the need for a DR. This saves overhead in the LSDB as well as resources on the routers. By default, any interface with a speed greater than 100 Mbps will be calculated with a cost of 1. For the most optimized paths in a network with high-speed interfaces, the reference bandwidth should be increased to provide better granularity. The value should be configured consistently throughout the OSPF domain.",

The high-order bit pattern/high-order bit count format allows you to specify an exact match. The le operator matches any prefix that falls into the high-order bit pattern/high-order bit count with a mask length less than or equal to the value specified. The ge operator is the opposite: It allows you to match with a mask length greater than or equal to. These operators can also be combined in a single line to match only a range of mask lengths: high-order bit count",

Finally, the RPT is pruned after data is received from the SPT.",

With match all, the class map will only match IP packets marked with DSCP EF and the IP Precedence 5 values simultaneously.

Bits 5 to 7 (101) of the DSCP EF value map directly to IP Precedence 5 (binary value [101000]) for backward compatibility; for this reason, packets marked with DSCP EF will match both DSCP EF and IP Precedence 5 match entries. On the other hand, packets marked with the IP precedence 5 value only (binary value [101000]) are missing the first 3 bits of the DSCP EF value (110) and will not match the DSCP EF match entry.",

        "explanation":  "The DiffServ QoS model is based on the differentiation of traffic through various QoS classification and marking techniques. At Layer 2 this could be the 802.1Q P-bits, and at Layer 3 it could be the IP Precedence or DSCP values. Classification and marking should occur as close to the edge as possible so that traffic flows through the network with the marking in place.",

CS5 corresponds directly to IP Precedence 5; therefore, packets marked with a DSCP CS5 value (binary value [101000]) will be marked with an IP Precedence 5 value (binary value [101000]). The commands set ip precedence 5 will also mark the packets with an IP Precedence 5 value. The command apply dscp ef is not a valid command.

        "explanation":  "WRED is a congestion avoidance mechanism. It allows thresholds to be defined per-DSCP or per-precedence to allow certain packet classifications to be dropped more aggressively than others. The drops that occur are intentional to avoid filling the output queue; they allow TCP applications to reduce their throughput in reaction to the drops. The aggressiveness of the random drops can be tuned to avoid filling the output queue and tail dropping packets, which can have a negative effect on TCP applications. WRED can also set the ECN bits to allow supporting applications to reduce the throughput.",

        "explanation":  "FHRPs use an active/standby model with a virtualized address, which allows the multiple routers to take over the active role. Although it is possible to achieve active/active forwarding with GLBP, this does not apply to all FHRPs. The primary purpose of FHRPs is to provide seamless failover of a default gateway for attached hosts. Although IPv6 uses a neighbor discovery mechanism instead of ARP, it still requires the use of FHRPs for seamless default gateway redundancy.",

        "explanation":  "Static NAT requires a 1:1 mapping of local to global addresses. With a pooled NAT configuration, this is relaxed because translations are created on demand dynamically. When a translation remains idle for 24 hours, by default the translation times out, and the address is returned to the pool. A large number of translations would require many configuration lines with static NAT, and pooled NAT provides a reduction in the number of configuration lines needed. Both static and pooled NAT can be applied as inside or outside.",

Which of the following statements correctly describes this scenario?",
        "explanation":  "The client will not be able to receive the AP\u0026#39;s signal successfully at the desired data rate because the level will be lower than the receive sensitivity. To confirm this, add the transmit power level, antenna gain, and free space path loss along the path and then compare to the receive sensitivity value. The end result is 5 dBm + 4 dBi - 78 dB = -69 dBm, which is less than -67 dBm. Even so, perhaps the AP could leverage DRS to lower the data rate toward the client. Lower data rates usually require lower receive sensitivity values, so maybe there is a less-than-desirable data rate that could work instead.",

        "explanation":  "A patch antenna is directional, so it would focus RF energy downward toward the classroom seating to cover a relatively small area. A dish antenna is also directional but much more so. If it were used, it would likely focus on an area that would be too small to be practical. An omnidirectional antenna is less focused, and the RF energy would propagate more or less equally around the antenna. That would cover too much area in the classroom. A dipole antenna is a type of omnidirectional antenna, so it would not be well suited for the scenario.",

This is because the two graphs (E and H) show actual measurements taken in a complete circle around the AP in two different planes.

        "explanation":  "A lightweight AP always has to check whether its own code image version is different than that of the WLC it joins. If the versions are different, the AP has to download the WLC\u0026#39;s version of code and reboot itself to run the downloaded version. That process takes time and will be disruptive to the end users. Therefore, it is always a good idea to make sure that all WLCs run a consistent version of code.",

        "explanation":  "Each AP can be primed with a primary, secondary, and tertiary WLC name or IP address to be used during controller failures. The idea is to point the APs toward another working controller. A list of DNS servers would not help during a controller failure. The names of nearby APs would not help either because a WLC is needed. An AP cannot easily switch to autonomous mode on its own. Even if it could, its connectivity would likely be broken because the switch port where the AP is connected would not be configured in trunking mode with multiple VLANs to extend to multiple WLANs and SSIDs.",

In other words, wireless client devices are authenticated to the APs by simply using the 802.11 standard. EAP, Local EAP, and PSK all require an authentication method other than None or Open Authentication. WebAuth is the only one that can authenticate users through web-based authentication, which can be used in conjunction with Open Authentication, PSK, or EAP.",

EAP is a framework that can work with many underlying authentication schemes. Dynamic Rate Shifting (DRS) is not involved with authentication because it is used by wireless devices to change data rates as needed. WEP can be used as a deprecated method to authenticate wireless devices but not the identity of wireless users. CAPWAP is the tunneling protocol to connect APs and WLCs, and it is not used for authentication.",

        "explanation":  "Based on the information given, it seems that the users experiencing the problem are all located in the same room and are perhaps using the same AP. You could begin by searching for and inspecting information about each user, but that would take extra time. That might be an efficient approach if only one user were reporting the problem. Instead, you should probably focus on the APs that are in the classroom. By searching for the APs, you can confirm that they are all powered up and joined to the controller. You can also inspect the channel utilization on each one. High channel utilization translates to poor performance for the associated users. Searching controller logs would likely waste time because the problem appears to be isolated to one room and maybe one AP. Inspecting switch interfaces for errors can be a useful troubleshooting step later on, once you have ruled out obvious, common issues with the RF conditions at the AP and user location.",

        "questionText":  "Suppose you have received reports of a wireless problem in one area of a building. You search the wireless LAN controller supporting the APs in that building and look at the Clean Air information about APs in the affected area. Clean Air shows an active interferer on channel 40, which is a channel used by at least one AP in the area. Based on this information, which of the following actions should you take?",
        "explanation":  "Because Clean Air has confirmed the presence of an interference source near your APs and users, you should try to locate the interferer and its owner. Hopefully you can work with the owner to either replace the device or move it to a different unused frequency or location. You should also consider moving your affected APs to a different channel, away from the interference. Turning off your APs will keep them away from the interference, but it will also keep your users away from the network. From the information given in the question, users on channel 40 are being affected, so you should try to take some action to mitigate the problem.",

        "explanation":  "The traditional Layer 2 access layer primarily faces challenges with spanning tree protocol limitations such as the potential for loops and blocked interfaces that allow capacity to remain unused. Redundancy should be implemented at the distribution layer since this is where the Layer 2 to Layer 3 handoff point is located. If a non-VSS or stackwise switching platform is used, an FHRP is required to provide default gateway redundancy.",

        "explanation":  "The two-tier model is primarily suited for a network with only a few distribution switches that does not require a dedicated core layer. The decision may also be driven by the building or campus layout. Typically, a single building would fall into the collapsed core model. This may also be determined by the bandwidth required between the various service blocks of the network, WAN aggregation, Internet edge, and data center throughput requirements.",

Different designs may warrant deviations. It really comes down to best-practices which can be applied. I noted the feedback but I don\u0026rsquo;t believe any change is needed. The readers should reference chapter 22, figures 7 and 8 and consider the traffic flow from users to the internet or service blocks, as well as traffic between different access switches which require routing at the distribution layer. The text referenced when creating this question from chapter 22 was here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u0026rdquo;The hierarchical LAN design is more appropriate for north-south traffic flows, for example, endpoints communicating with the WAN edge, Data Center, Internet or Network services blocks.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tMeaning that the capabilities of the distribution devices can handle north south flows to the internet, etc, and east-west between the network blocks on the top. If scale is too much for the distribution to handle, then moving to a 3-Tier can separate some of the east/west and north/south traffic onto different links/devices shifting load away from the distributions. 11/29 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The primary benefits are better uplink utilization since access switches can connect via EtherChannel to the distribution and load share across both links without STP blocking either port. There is no requirement for any FHRP, which further simplifies troubleshooting. Convergence occurs very quickly because EtherChannel provides subsecond convergence when a bundle member fails and no spanning tree topology changes occur.",

        "explanation":  "Graceful Restart (GR) is a standards-based feature, and it is the only one that interacts with neighbor routers. During an RP switchover, GR is deployed with SSO/NSF to protect the Layer 3 forwarding plane. For neighbor routers to continue forwarding traffic to the router undergoing an RP switchover, the neighbor routers must support the GR routing protocol extensions. The GR extensions enable a neighbor router to be aware in advance that the router undergoing the RP switchover can continue to forward packets. Still, they may bring down its routing adjacency for a brief period.",

        "explanation":  "EEM scripts are very powerful tools for automating data collection or handling configuration tasks on Cisco routers. An EEM script is completely contained in the device on which it is configured. An EEM script can be triggered by using a CLI command, syslog string match, tracking object, timers, and so on. The action sequences are typically CLI commands but could also generate syslog messages or send email messages. The sequences in an EEM script are interpreted as strings rather than as integers; they are commonly written as 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 so that later actions such as 2.5 can be inserted.",
