Also, using 5-GHz channels 36 and 40 would also result in nonoverlap because the usable 5-GHz channel numbers are spaced appropriately so that they do not overlap.\n\nFor the incorrect answers, in the 2.4-GHz band, channels 1 and 2 are spaced much too closely, causing extensive overlap. In the 5-GHz band, the available non-overlapping channel numbers increment by 4: channels 36, 40, 44, 48, and so on. So, the answer that suggests using 5 GHz channels 36 and 37 is invalid.",

You should not use just any channel, as the APs could overlap with each other quite easily.

        "explanation":  "Wi-Fi devices can use frequencies that are in the 5-GHz band. IEEE 802.11a devices use the 5-GHz band, while 802.11g devices must use the 2.4-GHz band. Therefore, 802.11a frequencies are higher than 802.11g. A 5-GHz signal oscillates at 5 billion cycles per second, not 5 million. The frequency of a signal is related to a channel number; increasing frequencies correlate to increasing channel numbers.",

It would not make sense to use the sender\u0026rsquo;s own MAC address as the destination. The sending device\u0026rsquo;s IP address cannot be used either because the Layer 2 destination address in the frame must be in the format of a MAC address. The AP\u0026rsquo;s Ethernet MAC address should not be used because it represents the address of the wired port and not the wireless radio.",

Those flows indicate the use of the\u0026nbsp;802.1x/EAP authentication method.\n\n\t1- The device authenticates with the AP, and the actual client authentication process is done with an external authentication server through the WLC.\n\t2- The WLC controls the user access with 802.1x and communicates with the authentication server .\n\n\tThe incorrect answers do not happen to use the processes shown in the figure. For instance, open authentication does not authenticate the client. In the past, WEP provided encryption and authentication, but was deprecated long ago. CCMP works as a useful current encryption method, but it does not use the protocols shown in the figure.",

        "explanation":  "WPA2-Personal mode uses a pre-shared key to authenticate wireless devices. Therefore, the pre-shared keys must be configured on every wireless device. If the key ever needs to be changed, network administrators must touch every device to enter a new key. As well, the 4-way handshake can be captured, allowing malicious users to launch an offline dictionary attack to recover the actual pre-shared key. WPA2-Personal does not involve the use of authentication servers or digital certificates.",

The switch ports where the WLC connects are also configured as trunk links that are bundled as a single logical EtherChannel using LACP. You notice that data is not passing across the links as expected. Which of the following would likely be the cause of the problem?",
        "explanation":  "The AireOS WLC does not support any form of EtherChannel negotiation, so the switch ports should be configured for unconditional EtherChannel operation. The root cause of the problem is that the switch has been configured to expect LACP negotiation from the WLC before the EtherChannel will come up, but the WLC does not support it. For the best link redundancy and load balancing, all of the WLC distribution system ports should be configured in LAG mode, as the question text described. (In contrast, an IOS-XE based WLC does support LACP negotiation if the switch ports are configured to use it.)",

        "questionText":  "Suppose you are preparing to deploy a new wireless LAN in your network. The APs are all joined to a single IOS-XE controller. You have carefully configured the WLAN and policy profiles with the new WLAN\u0026rsquo;s SSID, security, and the correct VLAN number. Then you mapped those profiles to a policy tag called Main_policy_tag. You made sure the new WLAN was enabled and that it would be broadcast. You also enabled the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands for the WLAN. You feel comfortable that any other parameters related to AP operation and RF settings will be inherited from the default profiles that come preconfigured on the controller. \n\nFor some reason, the new WLAN does not seem to be working\u0026mdash;no users can pick up the new SSID from it. Which one of the following is most likely the step you have forgotten to perform?",
        "explanation":  "From the problem description, it sounds like you did everything correctly. You built the WLAN and policy profiles for the new WLAN, made sure the WLAN was enabled and used on the correct frequency bands, and made sure the SSID would be broadcast so clients could discover it. However, all the work you put into configuring the profiles were never actually used by the APs. That\u0026rsquo;s because you must have forgotten to apply the profile tag to the APs so they could pick up the new WLAN configuration.",

Remember that the dynamic interface is used to logically map a VLAN to a WLAN. The WLAN configuration does not define the BSSID; that is determined by each AP and the WLAN it offers. In addition, you cannot specify specific channel numbers to use on the WLAN. Channels can be configured for a band or an RF profile as part of more advanced wireless functions on the WLC GUI.",

The WLC uses the WLAN ID as an internal number for wireless LANs, supporting values from 1-512. The VLAN ID must match the VLAN ID used in the distribution system (the wired network), with WLC supporting values 1-1001 and 1007-4094.\n\nFinally, the dynamic interface name is a text name that does not match any other listed fields.",

        "questionText":  "The figure shows a typical basic network, with servers, PCs, layer 2 LAN switches, and IP routers. PC1 has opened a web browser to connect to web server S1. In response to a request for a web page, the server sends 1000 TCP segments to PC1. All 1000 TCP segments arrive at PC1 with no problems. However, the window size used on this TCP connection started small and then grew over time while those 1000 TCP segments were being sent. What happens to grow the window size?",
        "explanation":  "The key to answering this question revolves around the following key concepts:\n\n\t\n\t\tIn each TCP connection, two independent windowing mechanisms exist: a window of data for sending data from one host to the other, and vice versa. That is, host 1 can send X data to host 2, and host 2 can send Y data to host 1, with X and Y being the two independent windows.\n\t\n\t\tThe receiving host chooses the size of the window; the sending host does not choose the size of the window.\n\t\n\t\tThe receiving host informs the sending host of the current allowed window size by listing the window size in the Window field in the TCP header.\n\n\n\tWith these facts in mind, in this case, PC1 would need to send a TCP segment to server S1. That segment lists the Window field. That value represents the number of bytes server S1 can send for its next window of data for this TCP connection.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers, two of those refer to PC1 and setting values in a TCP segment sent to server S1. While the general mechanism is correct, those answers refer to fields used for acknowledging data and performing error recovery, rather than managing the size of the window.\n\n\tThe two other answers suggest that the server chooses how large a window to use when sending data. With TCP, the sender does not choose the window size; instead, the sender is granted or given the right to send a window of data as specified by the receiving host, as described earlier.",

        "explanation":  "For the purposes of the CCENT and CCNA exams, the address specified in the statement (in the question) is assumed to be the correct subnet number (thus the lowest available address in the matched IP range). That said, to convert a wildcard mask back to a subnet mask, use the following technique: Take 255 and subtract the wildcard mask octet value. The first and second wildcard octets is 0, 255 \u0026ndash; 0 = 255. The third wildcard octet is 31, 255 \u0026ndash; 31 = 224. The fourth wildcard octet is 255, 255-255 = 0. This gives you a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The range of addresses can be found by taking the wildcard mask and adding it to the original network number configured. This will give you the highest range address; 192 + 0 = 192, 30 + 0 = 30, 32 + 31 = 63, 0 + 255 = 255. This makes the lowest number in the range 192.30.32.0 and the highest number 192.30.63.255.",

        "explanation":  "There are four different types of ACL that are taught in the CCNA: standard numbered, extended numbered, standard named, and extended named. The standard numbered ACLs use the range 1\u0026ndash;99 and 1300\u0026ndash;1999, and the extended numbered ACLs use the range from 100\u0026ndash;199 and 2000\u0026ndash;2699.\n\n\tNamed ACLs use names instead of numbers to identify the ACLs, making that answer incorrect.

The show ip interface command output lists those two ACLs on separate consecutive lines. Alternately, suppose the configuration uses the ip access-group\u0026hellip; out interface subcommand, which omits the common keyword. In that case, it defines a normal ACL for that direction \u0026ndash; and informs the router not to use a common ACL.\n\nIf no ip access-group command exists under the interface for a given direction, both output lines list \u0026ldquo;not set\u0026rdquo; at the end of the output lines.\n\nIn this question, the output lists ACL names on all four lines, revealing that the configuration commands for both directions use the common keyword. Focusing on the two lines which begin \u0026ldquo;Outgoing,\u0026rdquo; the output does not state \u0026ldquo;not set\u0026rdquo; but lists words \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;two.\u0026rdquo; You can infer that \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;two\u0026rdquo; are ACL names. You can infer that the configuration includes the ip access-group common one two out command, referring to the ACLs named one and two. \n\nSimilarly, the two output lines beginning \u0026ldquo;Incoming\u0026rdquo; lists two names rather than the text \u0026ldquo;not set,\u0026rdquo; so you can infer the use of the ip access-group common \u0026hellip; in interface subcommand.

Clients on the right side of the figure connect to the web servers on the left. All web servers use default well-known ports. When a client connects using HTTP 1.1 with TLS, which ACE matches the packets?\n\n\nR1# show access-list Hannah\n  10 permit udp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443 any\n  12 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443 any\n  20 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 any\n  22 permit udp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 any\n\u0026hellip;",
        "explanation":  "The web servers reside on the left side of the figure in subnet 172.16.10.0/24. Calculate the wildcard mask based on the DDN mask to match addresses in that subnet. First, /24 converts to DDN mask 255.255.255.0. Subtract that value from 255.255.255.255 to find the wildcard mask:\n\n255.255.255.255 \u0026ndash; 255.255.255.0 = 0.0.0.255\n\nAll the ACEs use the correct subnet ID and wildcard mask for this question. They also all use the any keyword as the destination address. Given the location as an outbound ACL on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 interface, the ACL attempts to match the correct packets: those sourced by the web servers in subnet 172.16.10.0/24\u0026nbsp;and destined for any other address.\n\nAs for matching web traffic, you need to be aware of HTTP versions, the transport protocol used by each, and the default well-known ports. They include:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using TLS and Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nIn this case, the question asks about HTTP 1.1 with TLS. The ACE must match TCP (the correct transport protocol) and well-known TCP port 443 to match those packets. Note that all the ACEs place the well-known port in the source port location in the command because the ACL matches packets sent by the server. As a result:\n\n\n\tACE 10 does not match due to the udp keyword.\n\tACE 12 does match, due to: TCP, using the correct source and destination address values, with source port 443.\n\n\nThe router will not attempt to match later ACEs because IOS ACLs use first-match logic.",

        "explanation":  "Dating back to the early days of Cisco IOS, for numbered ACLs configured with global access-list commands, to delete one line from an ACL, you had to begin by deleting the ACL with the no access-list number global command. Then, you would configure access-list global commands to reconfigure all the lines you wanted in the ACL, in the correct order. Alternatively, using the same configuration process IOS supports for named ACLs to configure numbered ACLs. That process supports ACL configuration mode and line numbers, allowing you to remove one line in the ACL. To do so, once in ACL configuration mode for the ACL, the no line-number command deletes one line of the ACL.",

On IOS and IOS XE, the show access-list command lists the line numbers used for each ACE in an ACL \u0026ndash; even for ACLs defined by numbered ACL access-list global commands.\u0026nbsp;By default, IOS assigns line numbers starting at 10 for increments of 10, so the first line of the ACL (represented by the answers) will use line number 10. These facts rule out two answers as incorrect.\n\nIf the ACL has been enabled on an interface, and packets have matched the ACE, the show access-list command lists a count of the number of matches for that ACE. The question states that an engineer enabled the ACL. Given that users could connect to the servers before enabling the ACL, but now they cannot, it appears\u0026nbsp;that the ACL matches (and denies) those packets. As a result, the command should list a line-ending statistic about the number of packets that matched the ACE.

The source addresses in the ACL define these ranges, all of which include the source address 10.22.33.30 in the question.\n\n\n\tLine 10: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.63\n\tLine 20: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.127\n\tLine 30: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.31\n\tLine 40: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.255\n\n\nFrom that analysis, you can see that lines 20 and 40 emcompass the range of source addresses in the question stem, ruling out lines 10 and 30 as possible correct answers.\n\n\n\n\nFor ACEs 20 and 40, line 20 matches the SSH well-known port 22 as the source port, not the destination port, so its logic cannot match packets destined to an SSH server. Line 40 works because it matches the source and destination addresses per the question and also matches SSH as the destination port, port 22.",

The goal is to permit all traffic from any source address destined for web servers in the new data center subnet 10.10.48.0/20. Your ACEs should match web traffic that uses all HTTP versions\u0026nbsp;with\u0026nbsp;the servers using\u0026nbsp;default port numbers. Which answers list one of the ACEs? (Choose three answers.)",
        "explanation":  "The question asks for ACEs that support all HTTP versions. That includes:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP, with the default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using\u0026nbsp;TLS (Secure HTTP).\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nAdditionally, to match the addresses in subnet 10.10.48.0/20, calculate the wildcard mask based on the DDN mask. First, /20 converts to DDN mask 255.255.240.0. Subtract that value from 255.255.255.255 to find the wildcard mask:\n\n255.255.255.255 \u0026ndash; 255.255.240.0 = 0.0.15.255\n\nThe correct answers all match the source address with the any keyword. They match the destination address with the combined subnet ID and wildcard mask of 10.10.48.0 0.0.15.255. The three correct answers then match TCP destination port 80 (for HTTP 1.0 traffic), TCP destination port 443 (for HTTP\u0026nbsp;1.1 and 2.0 traffic with TLS), and UDP destination port 443 (for HTTP 3.0 traffic.)",

        "explanation":  "Cisco IOS has long supported one IP ACL, per interface, per direction (in or out). For example, the ip access-group acl_01 out and ip access-group acl_02 in commands can coexist on an interface because they use opposite directions. However, if at that point you also configured another command to enable an IP ACL in the same direction on that interface \u0026ndash; for instance, using the ip access-group acl_03 out command - it would replace the ip access-group 1 out command as the only outbound IP ACL on the interface.\n\n\nWith the IOS XE Common ACL feature, you can configure two IP ACLs per interface per direction. The command syntax changes to ip access-group common common-acl regular-acl in|out. IOS XE processes the ACLs as if it matches the common ACL first and then the regular ACL. As a result, the long-held rule of one IP ACL per interface per direction expands to two ACLs.",

Your boss wants a working solution with little clutter, so he wants a solution that uses only one new ACE in the ACL. Which answer shows the option you think your boss will like best?",
        "explanation":  "First, consider a few background facts. POP3 uses TCP. IANA reserves well-known port 110 for POP3 without TLS and port 995 when POP3 uses authentication and encryption. The Cisco pop3 ACL keyword\u0026nbsp;matches port 110, but it has no keyword for POP3 with encryption.\n\nWorking through various incorrect answers:\n\n\n\tThe answer that lists one command with the pop3 keyword fails because it does not match all POP3 traffic. It matches only POP3 without TLS.\n\tThe answer with the list keyword fails with a syntax error because the command does not support a list keyword.\n\tThe answer with the range 110 995\u0026nbsp;parameters has correct syntax and matches both POP3 well-known ports, but it also matches all port numbers between 110 and 995\u0026nbsp;inclusive, denying far more traffic than desired.\n\n\nThe\u0026nbsp;remaining answer\u0026nbsp;meets all functional requirements,\u0026nbsp;but the correct answer uses\u0026nbsp;a single command. The single command that ends with eq 110 995\u0026nbsp;uses a syntax Cisco added to IOS XE to allow up to ten port numbers to be listed after the eq keyword. As a result, the command matches packets with destination port 110 or 995.",

Router R1 provides the IP helper feature with the ip helper-address 172.16.2.1 subcommand on its G0/0/0 interface. Which answers list an ACE that, if part of the ACL, would match DHCP messages between the server and clients?",
        "explanation":  "The DHCP messages per this question use:\n\n\n\tUDP\n\tSource address 0.0.0.0 (client address before leasing an address)\n\tDestination IP address 255.255.255.255 (destination used by clients because they do not know the DHCP server\u0026rsquo;s address.)\n\tDestination port 67 (bootps)\n\n\nIn this scenario, the ACL inbound on R1\u0026rsquo;s G0/0/0 interface processes the DHCP messages before the IP helper function on R1 changes the IP addresses. As a result, at this point, the router must match the special-purpose source and destination addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255, respectively.\n\nOf the two answers that use the ip protocol keyword, both attempt to match address 172.16.2.1. The DHCP messages do not use that address as the source or destination address, making those answers incorrect.\n\nThe one incorrect ACE referencing the udp protocol keyword attempts to match destination address 172.16.2.1, an address not used in the packet header. That ACE also attempts a match of the wrong destination port (bootpc instead of the correct bootps.) \n\nThe correct answer checks the correct bootps destination port. It also examines the exact source address 0.0.0.0, the correct source address of the packets sent by the DHCP clients.",

        "explanation":  "First, note that the question tells us the commands exist in a text editor and are pasted into configuration mode. That sequence means that the commands, as shown, may be incorrect and be rejected by IOS outright. However, all four ip\u0026nbsp;access-group interface subcommands have the correct syntax.\n\nThe four syntactically correct consecutive ip access-group interface subcommands reside under the same interface and refer to the same inbound direction. Repeating an ip access-group command under the same interface for the same direction replaces any previous command for that same direction. So, the router accepts each command in succession, but it replaces the previous one. Only the final ip access-group command shown in this question\u0026nbsp;remains in the configuration by the end of the configuration process. That command sets the common ACL to the ACL named \u0026quot;four,\u0026quot; which is the correct answer.\n\nThe show ip interfaces command output from IOS XE lists four lines about enabled interface ACLs. If the configuration uses the ip access-group common\u0026hellip; in command, it defines two ACLs in the same direction: A common ACL and a regular ACL. The show ip interface command output lists those two ACLs on separate consecutive lines. The line that begins \u0026quot;IP Common access list is\u0026quot; ends with the name or number of the enabled common ACL, in this case, \u0026quot;four.\u0026quot;\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "Two answers mention ACLs on interfaces. For an ACL enabled on an interface, inbound ACLs can work. A router processes all incoming packets with an inbound ACL. However, a router does not process self-generated packets with any enabled outbound ACL, so outbound ACLs would not attempt to match SSH packets generated by the router. \n\nThe access-class command in vty mode enables an ACL to filter Telnet and SSH traffic in the router. Inbound, the ACL filters incoming SSH/Telnet connections from external clients \u0026ndash; the function described in the question. Outbound, the ACL filters traffic generated by a router CLI user who uses the telnet and ssh commands to connect out of the router CLI \u0026ndash; which is not the function described in the question.",

        "explanation":  "A virus is a type of malicious application that can move from device to device relatively easily. The difference here is that a virus would need to properly infect another application, and then that application would need to be moved by an end user to another device.\n\n\tA Trojan horse is a type of malicious application that is wrapped inside another application, which hides the Trojan horse from detection. If a user decides to install the safe wrapper application, the Trojan horse is also installed but without the end user\u0026rsquo;s knowledge. Once installed, the Trojan horse can compromise a system or exfiltrate data. A Trojan horse cannot spread from device to device or application to application without user interaction.\n\n\tOne of the most sophisticated types of malware, called a worm, can actually self-replicate itself and constantly spread on its own. This makes a worm one of the hardest types of malware to mitigate properly.",

Each approved digital certificate is approved for a specific account only.\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tBiometric scanners use something inherent to the user (fingerprint, eyescan, facial imprint, and so on), and has been termed \u0026ldquo;something you are.\u0026rdquo; These devices use \u0026ldquo;something you are\u0026rdquo; (eye, finger, voice, face, etc.) to help strengthen the security of your account.

Each of these capabilities makes it easier and more efficient to block malicious traffic.\n\n\tBoth a traditional IPS as well as an NGIPS will filter based on a signature database downloaded by the IPS, so it is not a difference between the older IPS and newer NGIPS.",

        "explanation":  "A stateful firewall has the capability to track historical information about traffic that has passed through it, to then make semi-intelligent decisions based on that historical information. With these capabilities, a stateful firewall is properly enabled to mitigate a DoS attack. For instance, if can monitor the number of TCP connections to each IP address over time, watching for volumes that seem out-of-range versus normal operation.\n\n\tA stateless firewall and router ACL do not have the mechanisms or capabilities to provide any sort of historical information about the traffic that has passed through the security function. While they can match individual packets, they cannot consider past packets and trends that can identify a DoS attack.\n\n\tA security zone is a security component of a firewall where a designation is determined. Normally there is an inside and outside security zone, and traffic can be segmented between these zones one way or another. For example, traffic initiated from the inside security zone can traverse through the outside security zone, but traffic initiated from the outside security zone cannot traverse the inside security zone without proper approval. A security zone does not mitigate a DoS attack.",

For an EtherChannel link, you must leverage the bonded virtual interface that is created, in this case Interface Port-Channel 10.

In addition, the question is inferring that the EtherChannel should be configured as a trunk and not as an access link; a simple switchport mode trunk solves this.",

To ensure you have a dynamic capability to allow the first three clients to connect to this port you must enable the command switchport port-security mac-address sticky. The final configuration item you need is how the switchport is going to act when the three-client threshold has been tripped.

Part of this process is securing the Ethernet ports that will be used by these terminals; this will be done by implementing Cisco\u0026rsquo;s port security feature on SW2 and SW3. Your boss wants to make sure that any traffic from unauthorized devices is logged but not affect the operation of the terminals. In this case, which port security violation mode should be configured on these ports?",
        "explanation":  "There are three different port security violation modes: shutdown, restrict, and protect. The shutdown mode will disable a port if a device with an unauthorized MAC address attempts to send traffic. The restrict mode will ignore any traffic from unauthorized MAC addresses, log the violation, and send a message to the SNMP manager (if it is configured), but it will NOT disable the port. The protect mode will ignore any traffic from unauthorized MAC addresses, but it will not log the violation or send a message to the SNMP manager or disable the port.",

You accomplish this with these commands: ip dhcp snooping and ip dhcp snooping vlan 20 on SW2. The ports all use a default setting of untrusted for DHCP Snooping, meaning that DHCP Snooping will prevent PC4 from becoming a DHCP server.\n\n\tAdditionally, to support normal DHCP operations, you need to change some ports to be trusted so that SW2 will not filter DHCP messages originally sent by the legitimate DHCP server. The server connectes to SW2\u0026#39;s Gi0/12 port, also in VLAN 20. To allow those server messages, SW2 also needs an\u0026nbsp;ip dhcp snooping trust\u0026nbsp;command on SW2\u0026#39;s port Gi0/12, which connects to the DHCP server.\u0026nbsp;",

Those two features can be tricky and subtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThat said, in this question, keep this concept in mind: Which switch ports might receive messages sent by a legitimate DHCP server? In the topology shown, on SW2, the only legitimate DHCP server is on SW2\u0026rsquo;s G0/24, so that\u0026rsquo;s the only port that needs to be trusted. That other port you believe should be trusted, SW2\u0026rsquo;s G0/12, would not receive messages from a legit DHCP in the network shown.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\tNow, if other legit DHCP servers existed on the other side of that router, and just were not shown in the figure, then yes, you\u0026rsquo;d have a reason to trust that port.\u0026quot;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t6/8 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t3/1 - ok as-is, \u0026quot; A \u0026ldquo;rogue\u0026rdquo; DHCP server is not the normal intended DHCP server, but with the attacker running a DHCP server on some other device. As worded, the question is attempting to note that the rogue DHCP server is running on PC4. The device labelled \u0026ldquo;DHCP Server\u0026rdquo; is the normal DHCP server supported by the IT staff. At the core of the question then is this: How do we prevent the attacker\u0026rsquo;s rogue DHCP server, running on PC4, from causing problems?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tTo answer your other question, the correct answer mentions interface G0/12 (the port connected to the legitimate DHCP server) because that port has some non-default configuration.

In this example, there is no match, so the ARP message is discarded.\n\n\tAlthough the DHCP Snooping binding table is shown in this figure, it is not specifically focusing on what DHCP Snooping does as a feature.\n\n\tGratuitous ARP is a process where a host would send out an ARP message to everyone on the subnet stating that this host has an updated MAC address. This figure does not show this process.\n\n\tThis figure does not show a normal ARP Reply, as the message sent by PC2 lists PC1\u0026#39;s IP address.",

        "explanation":  "This figure shows the process and workflow for Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI). Specifically, it is showing how DAI compares the incoming ARP message from PC2 with the DHCP Snooping binding table on SW1. In this example, there is a match, so the ARP message is allowed.\n\n\tAlthough the DHCP Snooping binding table is shown in this figure, it is not specifically focusing on what DHCP Snooping does as a feature.\n\n\tGratuitous ARP is a process where a host would send out an ARP message to everyone on the subnet stating that this host has an updated MAC address. This figure does not show this process.\n\n\tThe figure does not show a normal ARP request.",

Next, you need to trust the DHCP server uplink port on SW2 with ip dhcp snooping trust in port interface Gi0/12. Finally, you need to trust to the trunk link between SW1 and SW2 from SW1\u0026rsquo;s side of the connection so that DHCP messages sent by the server, arriving back at switch SW1, will not be filtered. You do this with the same command, ip dhcp snooping trust, but on SW1\u0026rsquo;s interface Gi0/24 interface.",

The configured NTP servers in this question would have a lower (better) stratum level than the configured ntp master 4 command. If all NTP servers were reachable, R1 would synchronize time with them over the internal clock. Because the connectivity to the two NTP servers is obstructed, R1 utilizes its local internal clock to synchronize time and to continue to provide time to the network.",

        "explanation":  "A few different commands are typically used to configure basic NTP; they include the ntp server, ntp peer, and the ntp master commands. The ntp server command indicates that a device intends to get its time from the configured server but is unwilling to give it to that server (it can, however, give time to other devices, as long as its primary source is active). The ntp peer command indicates that a device intends to get its time from the configured peer and is willing to give its time to that peer should that peer lose its primary clock source (this is usually configured as a backup configuration). The ntp master command configures a device as an authoritative clock source. This command is usually used along with the ntp server command on core devices to ensure that if the core device loses its primary clock source (as configured with the ntp server command), it can still offer an authoritative clock source to other devices that use it as their primary clock source. In this scenario, R1 would need to be configured with the ntp master 2 command to allow other devices to use it as their time source.",

The goal: disable CDP on the upper link (G1/0/1) and enable it for all others. The engineer creates four solutions they can copy/paste into global configuration mode. Which answer achieves the CDP configuration goal and will not result in any IOS messages about invalid commands?",
        "explanation":  "In this specific case, you can achieve the stated goal by enabling CDP by default so that any interface with a subcommand to change the setting will use CDP. Then, you combine that with the interface subcommand that disables CDP on that specific interface, overriding the default. In summary, the question asks to enable CDP on all interfaces but to override that setting for interface G1/0/1.\n\nCDP and LLDP use the same conventions with the run and enable keywords in the commands to enable/disable the protocols. Cisco chose the run keyword for the global commands and enable for the interface subcommands. As a result, the correct config is:\n\n\ncdp run                      ! Global command, default CDP on\ninterface GigabitEthernet 1/0/1\n  no cdp enable              ! Interface subcommand to override default\n\n\n\nTwo incorrect answers begin with a\u0026nbsp;cdp enable\u0026nbsp;command. The question describes a process of pasting the configuration into global config mode. However, IOS would reject the cdp enable command in this mode because it is not a valid IOS global command.\n\nThe other incorrect answer lists the no cdp run command after the interface G1/0/1 command. Even though in interface configuration mode, the IOS recognizes and accepts this valid global command - disabling CDP on all interfaces.",

        "explanation":  "The LLDP standard has used type-length-value (TLV) data structures since its original definition. For instance, the original LLDP standard defined TLVs that allow one device to inform a neighboring device about the first device\u0026rsquo;s name and port numbers used.\n\nUsing TLVs allows for easy future expansion of LLDP. LLDP Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) refers to a set of endpoint-focused TLVs. LLDP-MED includes the TLVs that enable switches to inform an attached IP phone what voice VLAN ID to use on the link. As another example, LLDP TLVs support the IEEE Power over Ethernet (PoE) standards so that the powered device (PD) can use LLDP-MED to inform the attached switch of its power needs.",

The timer value is set to 180 and the holdtime timer is set to 60.

Conversely, with an LLDP global default of disabled, interfaces do not use LLDP unless an interface subcommand enables it (lldp transmit and lldp receive.)\nHowever, the supplied configuration overrides the LLDP default, enabling LLDP globally with the lldp run global command. With those facts in mind, per the initial configuration, the question begins with the following:\n\n\n\tBoth CDP and LLDP globally enabled\n\tLLDP partially disabled on G1/0/2\n\tCDP is fully functioning, and LLDP is partially functioning on G1/0/2\n\n\nTo disable CDP on the interface, use the no cdp enable interface subcommand, as seen in the correct answer. To disable LLDP on the interface, you need both the no lldp receive and no lldp transmit subcommands. The configuration already includes the first, so the correct answer adds the second of those commands.\n\nTwo incorrect answers list a command IOS will reject: no lldp enable. While IOS uses the no cdp enable interface subcommand to disable CDP on an interface, IOS does not support a no lldp enable interface subcommand. Those answers would not disable LLDP and would also show a command error when pasting the configuration.\n\nFinally, consider the incorrect answer that begins with cdp run but which also has a no lldp transmit command. This answer makes the functions work as intended. However, it requires one additional command compared to the correct answer. The question asked for the briefest configuration that meets the goals, making this answer incorrect.",

In this case, mask 255.255.255.240, applied to 192.31.7.129, would give an address range of 192.31.7.128\u0026ndash;192.31.7.143, including the subnet number and subnet broadcast address. Because the range includes the .144 address, this command would be rejected. The ip nat pool mypool 192.31.7.129 192.37.7.144 netmask 255.255.255.224\u0026nbsp;command, with mask 255.255.255.224, causes IOS to calculate a range of 192.31.7.128\u0026ndash;159, which includes all the addresses, so the command would be accepted.",

If you performed NAT on that router, converting the network 192.168.1.0 addresses to use 10.0.0.1 (as would happen with the R1 configuration), NAT would work, but it would not allow traffic to flow back and forth to the Internet. The NAT solution needs to translate to the public IP address, in this case 23.0.0.2 as shown on R2\u0026#39;s F0/1 interface.\n\n\tFor the two incorrect answers that list R2 as the router: one is incorrect because the\u0026nbsp;NAT inside and outside interfaces are reversed, while the other uses the wrong wildcard mask (255.0.0.0) in the ACL.",

        "explanation":  "Private IP networks were originally intended for use inside  organizations that had no reason to connect to the Internet or to other  organizations. However, the looming IPv4 address shortage in the early  1990s required some solutions, one of which is NAT/PAT. PAT allows  organizations to use a small number of public IP addresses, assigning  private IP addresses to each individual host, with a device translating  addresses in packets sent to and from the Internet. This allows two  organizations to\u0026nbsp;use the same IP address ranges and still be able to  communicate through the Internet.",

        "explanation":  "Routers that use Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) always schedule the priority queue if packets exist in the queue. As a result, the other queues might suffer queue starvation when the link has too much load. To combat that issue, the LLQ feature also limits the amount of traffic that can be sent through the priority queue, discarding any excess traffic using a policing function, thereby leaving enough bandwidth for the non-priority queues.\n\n\tIn this specific question, for the correct answers, the LLQ feature schedules the queue with priority scheduling for the priority queue, but with limits as implemented by policing. It also schedules the other queues in a round-robin fashion.",

        "explanation":  "In a design situation like this, where VLANs are being spanned between multiple Layer 3 switches that have corresponding SVIs, you would want to implement a First Hop Redundancy Protocol, such as Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). There is a specific failure situation if you do not implement a FHRP. With host 1 having a configured default gateway of SW1, and SW1 having a failure situation that brings the device offline, host 1 has essentially lost all connectivity outside the local area network (VLAN). If you were to implement a FHRP like HSRP, this situation would be mitigated because the default gateway address would be a virtual IP address and MAC address that is shared between both SW1 and SW2.\n\n\tSTP prevents switching loops and should be used while also using any FHRP solution, with STP design considered with FHRP design. For example, the root bridge and secondary root bridge placements should be on SW1 and SW2 in the question to match the FHRP active and standby roles, respectively. With that said, STP is not the protocol that can resolve the issue with a default gateway going offline.\n\n\tRunning an IGP is important but the issue at hand is more of a default gateway redundancy situation.\n\n\tBGP is not pertinent to this question.",

        "explanation":  "Two answers discuss what happens during the first month of operation when only D1 works. HSRP, and all the FHRPs, work even a router realizes no other routers are participating in the group. D1 holds an HSRP election, finds no competition, wins, and becomes the HSRP active router.\n\nFor the other two related answers, you need to recall these facts about HSRP:\n\n\n\tIt defaults to a priority value of 100.\n\tHigher priority wins the election.\n\tThe preemption feature defaults to disabled.\n\tThe per-device preemption setting defines that device\u0026rsquo;s ability to preempt (or not.) \n\n\nFor the two answers that describe what happens after D2 powers up, note that neither layer 3 switch enables preemption. The question describes a classic case with a router joining the group after another router has been elected HSRP active (D1 in this case.) With preemption disabled, D2 does not attempt to take over the active role, even with a higher (better) HSRP priority.",

        "explanation":  "GLBP uses active/active load balancing within one GLBP group. To do so, one router or multilayer switch acts as the active virtual gateway (AVG), performing some important asks for the group. However, all routers (or multilayer switches) act as active virtual forwarders (AVFs), actively forwarding packets. (Those facts show the reasons for one correct and one incorrect answer.)\n\nTo allow multiple concurrent AVFs, each AVF uses a unique virtual MAC address. Over time, when different hosts ARP looking for the MAC address associated with the GLBP VIP, the AVG alternates replies, one with the virtual MAC of one of the AVFs, and the next for another AVF. By alternating the ARP responses, a subset of the hosts in the subnet refers to each AVF\u0026rsquo;s virtual MAC. So, a single host always sends packets to one AVF, but collectively the hosts send some packets to one AVF and some to the other.",

        "explanation":  "IOS keeps an environment variable for the present working directory (pwd) in the IOS filesystem. The IOS dir command lists files and directories in the pwd, but not files in any subdirectories, much like a Windows or Linux shell dir or ls command. Using the cd command, any user who has not changed their pwd to another directory begins with a pwd set to the bootflash:/ directory. (IOS also creates flash: as an alias for bootflash:.) So, the show flash: EXEC command displays the contents of the bootflash: directory with different formatting and detail compared to the dir command. In particular:\n\n\n\tThe dir command lists files and directories in the pwd but not files located in those subdirectories. The show flash: command lists all files \u0026ndash; those in the pwd plus all in subdirectories.\n\tThe two commands list used and free space in the filesystem differently. The show flash: command lists bytes used and bytes available, while dir lists total bytes and bytes free (available.)",

Also, note that the dir command lists files in the specific directory but does not list the files found in subdirectories.\n\nNext, consider the sequence of events with the three commands issued by the engineer. Both copy commands list the second filename with no directory and just the filename (backup1.txt and backup2.txt). As a result, these copy commands copy the file into the present working directory. Given that the user did not change their pwd using the pwd command, both commands copy files into the pwd, namely bootflash: As a result, both files reside in the bootflash: directory in this scenario.",

        "explanation":  "Multigig Ethernet introduced two new speeds: 2.5 Gbps and 5.0 Gbps. Before introducing multigig in the mid-2010s, the IEEE had released 1000BASE-T (late 1990s) and 10GBASE-T (mid-2000s). The popular 1000BASE-T standard required Cat 5E cabling, and many building owners deployed Cat 5E from wiring closets to locations on each floor. 10GBASE-T requires Cat 6A cabling to reach distances up to 100 meters\u0026mdash;that requirement forced building owners to consider upgrading the Ethernet cabling plant at some expense.\n\nThe IEEE engineered two new Ethernet speeds between 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps that work over the same cabling as 1000BASE-T (Cat 5E) at the same 100-meter distance. Those speeds are 2.5 and 5.0 Gbps. As for the incorrect answers, the IEEE has standards for 10 Gbps using UTP cabling (10GBASE-T). To date, the IEEE does not have UTP-based standards for 2 and 20 Gbps.",

PSE means Power Sourcing Equipment, referring to the switch that supplies power to the PD over the Ethernet cable.\n\nThe question asks about automatic detection for the initial power levels. That process uses the sensing of electrical signals. The PSE and PD create a circuit, with the PSE inducing a current on the circuit. The PD changes the signal by applying a specific amount of resistance. The returning signal, reduced by the electrical resistance applied by the PD, signals to the PSE that a PD exists. Knowing a PD exists, the PSE can supply a small initial current, just enough to allow the PD to initialize enough software to ask for additional power via layer two messages using CDP and LLDP.",

The switch uses layer 2 power classification with CDP or LLDP messages. (CDP and LLDP messages do not use or rely on IP, so they are considered layer 2 messages, which is why the mechanism is called layer 2 power classification.)\n\nFor the incorrect answers, PoE switches do not use a PoE API. Also, applying the maximum power to the port risks applying too much power \u0026ndash; instead, the more considered dynamic layer 2 messaging approach reduces the risk of harming the powered device.",

        "questionText":  "IEEE introduced multigig Ethernet to solve issues with then-current UTP-based Ethernet standards. Which answer describes one of the problems solved by multigig Ethernet?",
        "explanation":  "Multigig Ethernet introduced two new speeds: 2.5 Gbps and 5.0 Gbps. Before introducing multigig in the mid-2010s, the IEEE had released 1000BASE-T (late 1990s) and 10GBASE-T (mid-2000s). The popular 1000BASE-T standard required Cat 5E cabling, and many building owners deployed Cat 5E from wiring closets to locations on each floor. 10GBASE-T requires Cat 6A cabling to reach distances up to 100 meters\u0026mdash;that requirement forced building owners to consider upgrading the Ethernet cabling plant at some expense.\n\nThe IEEE engineered two new Ethernet speeds between 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps that work over the same cabling as 1000BASE-T (Cat 5E) at the same 100-meter distance. Those speeds are 2.5 and 5.0 Gbps. As for the incorrect answers, the IEEE has standards for 10 Gbps using UTP cabling (10GBASE-T). To date, the IEEE does not have UTP-based standards for 2 and 20 Gbps.",

This 5G subset uses some of the same protocols and technology as 4G LTE and goes by 5G Non-standalone (NSA) wireless, or sub-6. The reference to non-standalone refers to using the older 4G LTE network. The sub-6 term refers to the fact that it uses frequencies just below 6 GHz. \n\nIn contrast, 5G Standalone (SA) wireless (mmWave) ignores the older 4G technologies, requiring carriers to invest in new equipment and software. However, it provides must faster speeds. The word standalone means it does not rely on the older 4G network. The mmWave term, instead of frequency, refers to wavelengths \u0026ndash; the wavelengths used by this part of 5G are millimeters (mm) long.",

The VPN remains up and working under normal conditions. The endpoint hosts have no awareness of the existence of the VPN, with IP routing forwarding packets over the VPN and the VPN features encrypting the data. All devices at a site can send traffic over the site-to-site VPN. The two incorrect answers refer to attributes of site-to-site VPNs.\n\nRemote access VPNs support a single device. Sometimes, the host uses VPN client software to create an encrypted VPN connection to a remote site. For instance, a remote worker can use a VPN client on their laptop to create a secure VPN tunnel to the corporate network over the Internet. That VPN supports all packets sent by that one host but not for other hosts at the site. The user at that host can connect with the VPN software, use the connection, and stop it later as needed, as an on-demand service.",

        "explanation":  "Of the three answers that could be used over the Internet, site-to-site VPNs work best with multiple devices at each site. A site-to-site VPN creates one tunnel, configured on two devices, one at each location. Once the tunnel is functional, all devices at each site can communicate with devices in the other site.\n\nThe remote access VPN options using either IPsec or TLS would not be best given the design. Both\u0026nbsp;require each device to create their own VPN tunnel to each other device. Doing so in this case would require extra unnecessary work and would be difficult to scale and manage long term.\n\nThe other incorrect answer, MPLS VPN, uses a private WAN (MPLS) rather than the Internet, so it does not meet the requirements listed in the question.",

        "explanation":  "IPsec tunnel mode refers to the scope of encryption. With tunnel mode, the VPN endpoints receive packets created by other hosts. After receiving a packet, if the routing choice directs the packet over the VPN tunnel, the sender encrypts the original unencrypted IP packet. The sender creates a new IP packet with a new IP header. The source and destination of the new packet use the VPN tunnel devices\u0026rsquo; addresses as the source and destination of the packet. The original encrypted packet resides as data in the new packet. Once the receiving tunnel endpoint receives the packet, it extracts the data, which holds the encrypted original IP packet, and decrypts it.\n\nTunnel mode works well for site-to-site VPNs. Site-to-site VPNs must support traffic from many hosts with different IP addresses. Encrypting and later decrypting the original IP packet preserves the original source and destination IP addresses, making it easy to forward the packets after they exit the VPN tunnel.\n\nThe two incorrect answers describe IPsec transport mode. It works well for remote access VPNs for which one VPN connection supports, at most, a single host. One site has only one IP address to serve, implied as one of the tunnel endpoints. So, transport mode, which uses fewer overhead bytes, works well for IPsec remote access VPNs.",

        "explanation":  "A site-to-site VPN connects two sites by creating a tunnel between two IT-controlled devices (routers, firewalls, or network access servers.) The VPN remains up and working under normal conditions. The endpoint hosts have no awareness of the existence of the VPN, with IP routing forwarding packets over the VPN and the VPN features encrypting the data. All devices at a site can send traffic over the site-to-site VPN. The two incorrect answers refer to attributes of site-to-site VPNs.\n\nRemote access VPNs support a single device. Sometimes, the host uses VPN client software to create an encrypted VPN connection to a remote site. For instance, a remote worker can use a VPN client on their laptop to create a secure VPN tunnel to the corporate network over the Internet. That VPN supports all packets sent by that one host but not for other hosts at the site. The user at that host can connect with the VPN software, use the connection, and stop it later as needed, as an on-demand service.",

        "explanation":  "There are three different MEF-defined Metro Ethernet services: E-Line (Ethernet Line Service), E-LAN (Ethernet LAN Service), and E-Tree (Ethernet Tree Service). E-Line is used to connect two devices that can exchange Ethernet frames similarly to a point-to-point link; it has also been referred to by the name Virtual Private Wire Service. E-LAN acts similarly to a local LAN and allows all devices to directly connect to each other; it has also been referred to by the name Virtual Private LAN Service. E-Tree resembles a hub-and-spoke topology and allows a \u0026ldquo;hub\u0026rdquo; device to communicate with all \u0026ldquo;spoke\u0026rdquo; devices, but the \u0026ldquo;spokes\u0026rdquo; are not able to directly communicate without being relayed through the \u0026ldquo;hub.\u0026rdquo;",

        "explanation":  "A cloud-hosted email service is a perfect example of a Software as a Service offering.\n\n\tInfrastructure as a Service is an offering that provides a system, or multiple systems, that the consumer can leverage as needed. Usually these systems have an operating system pre-installed but then the consumer needs to install any applications and tools they need to complete their work.\n\n\tPlatform as a Service is the next step after Infrastructure as a Service. Platform as a Service also includes a system, or multiple systems, that can be leveraged as needed with a pre-installed operating system. The difference between IaaS and PaaS is that PaaS will have the needed tools and applications pre-installed as well.\n\n\tIT as a Service is offloading all of your IT systems, infrastructure, and services to a company that manages them for you.",

        "explanation":  "Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:\n\n\t\n\t\tOn-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.\n\t\n\t\tBroad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.\n\t\n\t\tResource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.\n\t\n\t\tRapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different from an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity it\u0026rsquo;s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.\n\t\n\t\tMeasured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.\n\n\n\tBoth agile network access and proactive service are unrelated to a cloud service offering and refer to business architecture principals.",

Which answers accurately compare and contrast VMs and containers? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "Virtual Machines (VMs) rely on a virtualization system with a hypervisor. The VM includes an installed OS, so starting a VLM includes initializing (booting) the OS. That process relies on the usual computer components: CPU, RAM, disk, and network. The hypervisor virtualizes those computer resources so the VM can be initialized and run.\n\nA container image does not include an OS and does not rely on a virtualization system or hypervisor. Instead, it depends on an OS with container support and a container engine. The container image includes all software components needed to run an application besides the OS. The container engine enables the management of starting and stopping containers.\n\nAs for the answers, VMs use a hypervisor, while containers do not, instead using a container engine. Also, initializing a VM includes booting an OS, so starting a VM may take several minutes. Starting a container takes seconds, more like the time taken to start an application.",

        "questionText":  "An engineer configures a router that formerly had no VRFs to add two VRFs. The configuration also places some interfaces in one VRF and some in another. How many IP routing tables does the router have now?",
        "explanation":  "Devices that perform routing - routers and multilayer switches - use virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instances to create multiple instances of a router within one device. Without VRFs, a router has a single routing table, and the router places all IP routes into one IP routing table. With VRFs, the router creates a routing table for each VRF. Additional configuration can place interfaces into the VRFs so that their connected routes land in the associated per-VRF routing table. The routing protocol configuration can also place routing protocol neighbor relationships into the different VRFs, so routes learned via those neighbors again land in the correct per-VRF routing table.\n\nA router without VRFs has a single IP routing table. Once configured to use VRFs, the router has the original IP routing table (the global routing table) plus one IP routing table per VRF. Interfaces and routing protocol neighbors not placed into a VRF feed their routes into the global routing table.\n\nIn this question, with two VRFs, the router has three IP routing tables: one per VRF plus the global routing table.",

The control plane is responsible for guiding the actions of the data plane; this includes finding the route so that it can be inserted into the routing table or learning the MAC addresses that are known on each switch and placing them into the MAC address tables. The management plane is all traffic that is used in the configuration or monitoring of the device itself; this includes protocols like Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH), Syslog, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).",

        "explanation":  "Networking devices can be split into three major planes: data, control, and management. The data plane includes the tasks a device takes to forward a message (frame and/or packet); this includes duties like matching and forwarding a packet based on the existing IP routing table or the transmission of a frame based on the existing MAC address tables. The control plane is responsible for guiding the actions of the data plane; this includes finding the route so that it can be inserted into the routing table or learning the MAC addresses that are known on each switch and placing them into the MAC address tables. The management plane is all traffic that is used in the configuration or monitoring of the device itself; this includes protocols like Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH), Syslog, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).",

        "explanation":  "Networking devices can be split into three major planes: data, control, and management. The data plane includes the tasks a device takes to forward a message (frame and/or packet); this includes duties like matching and forwarding a packet based on the existing IP routing table or the transmission of a frame based on the existing MAC address tables. The control plane is responsible for guiding the actions of the data plane; this includes finding the route so that it can be inserted into the routing table or learning the MAC addresses that are known on each switch and placing them into the MAC address tables. The management plane is all traffic that is used in the configuration or monitoring of the device itself; this includes protocols like Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH), Syslog, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).",

        "explanation":  "In a controller-based network architecture, the controller has its own responsibilities, which align with the duties of common control plane networking protocols like EIGRP, OSPF, and ARP or processes like MAC learning. The controller then uses this information to control the deployed devices via the Southbound Interface (SBI); but the controllers themselves need to be configured as well. This can happen using direct access to the controller or through a number of application programming interfaces (API). These APIs can then be used (via an application) to control how the network forwards the traffic; this interface into the controllers is referred to as the Northbound Interface (NBI).",

        "explanation":  "\u0026nbsp;\n\nWith legacy ACLs and how we as an industry have managed them over the years, there are a lot of inherent management nightmares. For example, ACEs could not be removed because of the potential risk of failure to the entire ACL. New changes add to the current ACL, which ends up being more complicated the longer it gets.\n\nCisco SD-Access instead uses group-based security with SGTs. Instead of hard coding a security rule in a list like an ACL, you can identify who and what something is, assign a value to it, and then look up that value in a grid or matrix to validate what the user should and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing. With this new model, there are some huge benefits:\n\n\n\tEach new security requirement can be considered separately from the existing policies.\n\tCisco SD-Access (through Cisco Catalyst Center) keeps the security policies clear as a grid of security groups and their allowed access\n\tAs a result, each policy can be removed without affecting another policy.\n\tThe user interface includes note-taking space to\u0026nbsp;track why a policy was created.\n\tThere is proper logging of when the policy is being used and by whom, and when the policy was last used.\n\n\nFor the incorrect answers, first, note that the user interface in Cisco Catalyst Center shows the SGT access policies as a grid, rather than showing the matching logic as compiled into an integrated whole, making it much easier to work with the policies. You can add new SGTs, and set their access rights (permit, deny), without considering any changes to the existing parts of the table.",

        "explanation":  "In a Cisco SD-Access fabric, the underlay IP addressing scheme uses a separate IP address space as compared to endpoint devices and the overlay network.

The underlay uses addresses from the range 172.16.0.0/12. Also, switches SW2 and SW3, which do not sit at the edge of the network (and are therefore not Fabric Edge or Fabric Border nodes), do not participate in the overlay at all. So, of the four answers, only the correct answer shows all four addresses from the underlay range 172.16.0.0/12.

Any value between 1 and 65535 is allowed.\n\t\n\t\tThe answer about multiple network commands with area 0 parameters is not correct.

        "explanation":  "REST stateless operation means that the server will not store any data about one API call for use in processing subsequent API calls. As a result, the REST client must send all data relevant to each API call with each call. Each call can include data, encoded as part of the URI path (resource) and parameters (query field).\n\n\tTwo of the incorrect answers refer to the REST server making use of information gathered in the first API call to process the second, which goes against stateless operation. The other incorrect answer claims that no data can be sent in a REST API call, whereas RESTAPI calls can include data in the parameter (query) field of a URI.",

        "explanation":  "\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tThere are six required attributes for REST APIs, including these two attributes:\n\n\t\n\t\tClient/server architecture: REST APIs operate in the client/server model. This means that an application is built with RESTful APIs that act as the server. A client computer or device would make a RESTful API call to the application.\n\t\n\t\tLayered system: With REST APIs, you can leverage the single URI to complete any task at hand. In the background you have no idea that the URI you used actually ended up utilizing several servers/services in the back end.\n\n\n\tAdditionally, note that while JSON data can be transferred over a REST API, REST does not require the use of JSON.\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "From the following options, what are the required REST API attributes?",
        "explanation":  "There are six required attributes for REST APIs:\n\n\t\n\t\tClient/server architecture: REST APIs operate in the client/server model. This means that an application is built with RESTful APIs that act as the server. A client computer or device would make a RESTful API call to the application.\n\t\n\t\tStateless operation: All of the state for the connections between client and server is actually on the client. The servers do not hold any state for that connection. This is good because it puts less load on the servers so they can process more requests. From a client perspective, the client must be sure to send the necessary information that the server will need to complete the request.\n\t\n\t\tClear determination of whether a resource can be cached: With REST APIs, servers can cache the most used resources. This is usually used with GET requests. Caching can speed up the operations and the responses to the users.\n\t\n\t\tUniform interface: In the RESTful world, everything is perceived to be a resource, no matter whether it\u0026rsquo;s a document, function, method, class, or module. This simple uniformity of interface leads to consistency and rapid deployment of new systems.\n\t\n\t\tLayered system: With REST APIs, you can leverage the single URI to complete any task at hand. In the background you have no idea that the URI you used actually ended up utilizing several servers/services in the back end.\n\t\n\t\tCode on demand: With REST APIs, you can determine what form of data you want back, and not just the values of data. If you want the form of data to be JSON, XML, or YAML, you can specify that. This is still all with a single URI because it\u0026rsquo;s just a value in the header of the request.\n\n\n\tFor the incorrect options, REST APIs do not run in a peer-to-peer architecture and do not leverage a dynamic interface.",

        "explanation":  "What is happening within the environment is known as configuration drift. Configuration drift is when changes are made to a device or multiple devices that are not the intended configurations.\n\n\tThis is not version control. Version control is tracking the different changes that have occurred in a repository or system and creating version numbers for each change. This enables you as an operator to restore a past configuration version if the need arises.\n\n\tCentralized configuration is a process of moving the configurations to a central server or service. The key with this process is to make sure future changes to configurations are actually completed on the central server and not on the individual devices themselves.\n\n\tConfiguration monitoring is an alert that the configuration of a device is different than the intended configuration. This allows an operator to resolve the configuration issue as soon as possible.",

This enables an operator to resolve the configuration issue as soon as possible.\n\n\tThis is not centralized configuration. Centralized configuration is a process of moving the configurations to a central server or service. The key with this process is to make sure future changes to configurations are actually completed on the central server and not on the individual devices themselves.\n\n\tVersion control is tracking the different changes that have occurred in a repository or system and creating version numbers for each change. This enables you as an operator to restore a past configuration version if the need arises.\n\n\tConfiguration drift is when changes are made to a device or multiple devices that are not the intended configurations.",

        "explanation":  "The IEEE defines the format and assignment of LAN addresses. The IEEE requires globally unique unicast MAC addresses on all LAN interface cards. To ensure a unique MAC address, the Ethernet card manufacturers encode the MAC address onto the card. The first half of the address identifies the manufacturer of the card. Each manufacturer assigns a MAC address with its own OUI as the first half of the address, with the second half of the address being assigned a number that this manufacturer has never used on another card.The timer \u0026ldquo;(min)\u0026rdquo; indicates how long ago the MAC address was learned or updated. A timers of \u0026ldquo;-\u0026ldquo; means that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t dynamically learned and usually represents the device\u0026rsquo;s own MAC address. A hardware address is 48 bits long, is a Layer 2 address, and is represented in 12 hexadecimal characters (with each representing 4 bits).",

The other two incorrect answers refer to two types of transceiver hardware used on fiber links: a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) and gigabit interface converter (GBIC), neither of which refer to cable types.",

        "explanation":  "When a router processes an incoming packet, the router de-encapsulates the packet from the data link frame and then re-encapsulates the packet in a new data link frame before forwarding the new frame. The reason is the changing data link layer addresses and/or interface technologies (Ethernet versus HDLC).\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tIn this case, the question asks how many times the packet will be encapsulated. Note that the packet begins within R1, not from a host outside R1. So, the IP packet will first be encapsulated on R1. From here, it will be sent to R2, which will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into another Ethernet frame. From here, R3 will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into an HDLC frame. From here, R4 will de-encapsulate the packet from the HDLC frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into an Ethernet frame. From there, the frame holding that packet will arrive at R5, which will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and process it. However, R5 will not encapsulate the packet for forwarding again, as R5 is the destination.\n\n\t\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tSo to add them up: R1 (encapsulate), R2 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate), R3 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate), R4 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate) = 4.",

A preamble is the concept of a recognizable bit pattern so that the receiving node will realize that a new frame is arriving. In HDLC, this is a field named Flag.",

        "explanation":  "Before the router looks at its routing table to determine the outgoing interface, it must de-encapsulate the layer 3 packet from inside the layer 2 frame. To do so, the router removes and discards the layer 2 frame header and trailer, a fact that identifies the correct answer.\n\n\tFor the other answers, note that layer 1 is not considered to use headers and trailers. Additionally, the routing process does not remove the layer 3 (packet) header or the layer 4 (transport) header.",

For the incorrect answers, hosts use DHCP to lease an IP address to use, along with learning the mask, default gateway, and DNS IP addresses. The IEEE 802.3 standard defines Ethernet, including Ethernet protocols and conventions like LAN switching and RSTP. Finally, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) acts as a data link protocol on serial links, and those links do not use MAC addresses.",

An ARP request, called an ARP broadcast, flows inside an Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address (MAC address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF). After receiving an ARP Reply from PC2, PC1 can send the ICMP Echo Request per the ping command to PC2 - a message PC1 encapsulates in a frame destined to PC2\u0026#39;s MAC address.\u0026nbsp;",

The TFTP source/destination is an option that allows engineers to save their configuration to an external device or to replace the local configuration with a remote copy.",

Which answer(s) describe the first frame sent by host B as a result of the ping command?\u0026nbsp;",
        "explanation":  "In this scenario, because of the recent boot, host B begins with an empty ARP table. As a result, host B needs to send an ARP request, also called an ARP broadcast, as the first frame. So this question asks about the flow of the ARP Request, which is a LAN broadcast, with a destination MAC address of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. As a result, all three switches flood the frame, so a copy of the frame is forwarded out all active interfaces in VLAN 1. As stated in the question, and as confirmed in the exhibit\u0026#39;s output, all interfaces are in VLAN 1. So, the frame will be flooded out all interfaces in the figure, except the interfaces in which a frame arrived into the switch.\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nConsidering each answer, beginning with the correct answers:\n\n\n\tThe answer that claims the frame will be forwarded to host D is correct, in that the frame - a LAN broadcast - will be forwarded to all the hosts, including host D.\n\tThe answer that claims that SW2 WILL\u0026nbsp;forward the frame out SW2\u0026#39;s G0/1 interface is correct for the LAN broadcast used for the ARP Request, as explained earlier.\u0026nbsp;\n\n\nIncorrect:\n\n\n\tThe frame will be forwarded into SW1, then to SW2, and then to SW3, which rules out one incorrect answer that claims that the frame would not be forwarded to SW3.\n\tThe answer that claims the frame will NOT be forwarded to host A is incorrect, because the frame - a LAN broadcast - will be forwarded to all the hosts, including host A.",

If the source MAC is not seen in the table, an entry will be added that will map the MAC address to the port. The switch will not examine the outgoing frames to build its MAC address table.",

You paraphrased some rules from the book but omitted the context. That text in the book describes what happens when one device disables auto negotiation. It goes on to say how Cisco switches work in that case. However, this question clearly states that the PCs and switch port use auto negotiation, so the rules you quoted do not apply here. Instead, the endpoints on each link choose the fastest speed that both support and the best duplex that both support, full being better than half.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e10/4 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8/8 - ok as-is \u0026quot;Interesting, it looks like you are referring to the logic used when IEEE auto-negotiation does not work. In this question, it is working, as detailed in the explanation to the question. In short, both ends state their best speed and best duplex, and they agree to use the fastest speed that both support at use the better duplex (full) if both support it. In this case, one supports 1 Gbps, the other support 100 Mbps, and both support full duplex. So, they agree to the fastest speed that they both support (100 Mbps), and to use the best duplex they both support (full). There\u0026rsquo;s no need to use auto-negotiation defaults for duplex because the auto-negotiation process is working, with both devices stating their abilities.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8/4, 7/26 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6/28 - ok as-is, \u0026quot; With both the switch and PC using auto negotiation, they communicate the idea that they each can support both half and full duplex, and then they both choose the better option: full duplex. I wonder if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of the default choice of auto negotiation that would happen if one device did not use auto negotiation. For example, if PC B disabled auto negotiation, SW1 could sense that PC B was using 100 Mbps - without using autonegotation but by sensing the electrical signal - and choose the correct 100 Mbps speed. But without those auto negotiation messages, that\u0026rsquo;s the case in which SW1 would have to use the default duplex, which as you noted would be half duplex if the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps. Different case in this question - both ends use autonegotiation, so they both choose the better duplex setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6/23 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6/17 - sent reader suggestion to au,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8/18 - ok as-is, Cisco does not use a separate auto negotiation standard. I wonder if you might have misread the question. The question stem states that auto negotiation is enabled. IEEE auto negotiation chooses the best (that is, full) duplex supported by both endpoints when auto negotiation is enabled and working. I wonder if you are thinking of the IEEE auto negotiation choice when the device on the other end of the link does not use auto negotiation, in which case at 10 and 100 MBps, the duplex would default to half. The book gets into comparing both sets of conditions (Vol 1 Chapter 7.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7/28 - query to Au, 11/18 - ok as-is, 10/29 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n",

        "questionText":  "The figure displays three PCs connected to a switch. All PC NICs support the highest speeds. Some PCs have power, and some have cables connecting them to the switch, but some have no power or no cable. The show interfaces status command lists both a speed and duplex column. Which answers accurately describe the output in those columns for the combined three interfaces? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "First, consider the three cases. On port G1/0/1, the PC has power, and a cable exists. As a result, the link works, and then autonegotiation works. However, on the other two links, a problem exists, so the link does not work. On G1/0/2, no cable exists, and on G1/0/3, the PC has no power. So, those links do not work, so no autonegotiation occurs.\n\nSecond, you must recall that the default settings for speed and duplex on switch interfaces cause them to use autonegotiation. As a result, the show interfaces status command, for interfaces in a down/down (notconnect) state, lists a status as if autonegotiation is yet to be done, using the word \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; in each case. So, the output for G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 lists the speed and duplex as \u0026quot;auto.\u0026quot; \n\nFor the working interface, G1/0/1, the output lists \u0026quot;a-1000\u0026quot; for the speed, meaning it autonegotiated to use 1000 Mbps. Similarly, the output shows \u0026quot;a-full\u0026quot; in the duplex heading, meaning it autonegotiated to use full duplex.\n\nThree answers suggest values under the speed column for two interfaces. Two interfaces will list a speed value of \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; (interfaces G1/0/2 and G1/0/3), making that answer correct. Three answers suggest values under the duplex column for exactly one interface. The answer listing \u0026quot;a-full\u0026quot; is correct, as interface G1/0/1 completes autonegotiation and chooses full duplex.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "When one link partner (in this case, host B) fails to use IEEE auto-negotiation, and the other end attempts it (in this case, switch SW1), the switch can sense the speed, but it must choose a duplex setting based on a table of defaults. For the speed, the switch examines the electrical signals sent by host B and can discern the standard used by host B \u0026ndash; and then use that same standard. Then, for the duplex, it uses this table:\n\n\n\tFor 10 or 100 Mbps: Default to half duplex\n\tFor higher speeds: Default to full duplex\n\n\nIn this case, the switch senses and uses 100 Mbps and chooses half duplex from the list of defaults. This scenario shows a classic case of duplex mismatch between the two endpoints.",

Some PCs have power, and some have cables connecting them to the switch, but some have no power or no cable. The show interfaces status command lists both a speed and duplex column. Which answers accurately describe the output in those columns for the combined three interfaces? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "First, consider the three cases. On port G1/0/1, the PC has power, and a cable exists. As a result, the link works, and then autonegotiation works. However, on the other two links, a problem exists, so the link does not work. On G1/0/2, no cable exists, and on G1/0/3, the PC has no power. So, those links do not work, so no autonegotiation occurs.\n\nSecond, you must recall that the default settings for speed and duplex on switch interfaces cause them to use autonegotiation. As a result, the show interfaces status command, for interfaces in a down/down (notconnect) state, lists a status as if autonegotiation is yet to be done, using the word \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; in each case. So, the output for G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 lists the speed and duplex as \u0026quot;auto.\u0026quot; \n\nFor the working interface, G1/0/1, the output lists \u0026quot;a-1000\u0026quot; for the speed, meaning it autonegotiated to use 1000 Mbps. Similarly, the output shows \u0026quot;a-full\u0026quot; in the duplex heading, meaning it autonegotiated to use full duplex.\n\nThree answers suggest values under the speed column for one interface only. The answer that includes \u0026quot;a-1000\u0026quot; is correct, as only interface G1/0/1 has that speed status value. Three answers suggest values under the duplex column for two interfaces. The answer listing \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; is correct, as interfaces G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 would both list that value.",

        "explanation":  "First, note that all the ACEs match the correct source address range per the 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 parameters. Those parameters match the addresses in the server subnet. The ACEs all match any destination address using the any keyword. As a result, the question drills down on the other matching parameters.\n\nAs for matching web traffic, you need to be aware of HTTP versions, the transport protocol used by each, and the default well-known ports. They include:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using TLS and Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nIn this case, the question asks about HTTP/3. HTTP/3 uses only UDP (and not TCP) and uses\u0026nbsp;well-known UDP port 443 defined for QUIK to match those packets. HTTP/3 requires encryption, so HTTP/3 does not use well-known port 80. As for the ACEs, the correct ACE should match port 443 as the source port because the ACL\u0026#39;s location matches packets\u0026nbsp;sent by the server. As a result:\n\n\n\tACE 10 matches, due to: UDP, using the correct source and destination address values, with source port 443.\n\n\nThe router will not consider later ACEs because IOS ACLs use first-match logic, but none of the ACEs would match the packets anyway.",

As a result, you need to think about how SW1 will behave, which is the essence of the question.\n\nSwitch SW1 uses IEEE parallel detection rules to detect the speed to use on the link, even with autonegotiation disabled on the SW2 end\u0026nbsp;of the link. As a result, SW1 also uses 1000 Mbps (that is, 1 Gigabit/second). The IEEE parallel detection rules then state that to choose the duplex setting, use a default value based on the speed used. Those rules state that when running at 1 Gbps, to use full duplex. As a result, the link will come up because both switches use the same speed, and they will both use full duplex.\u0026nbsp;\n\nThe three incorrect answers show a variety of incorrect combinations versus what actually happens.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

The default on most Cisco access switches is switchport mode dynamic auto, which tells the switch to react to any received negotiation messages. So the switch port would negotiate trunking if the neighboring switch requested it.\n\nAnother incorrect answer lists the switchport access vlan x command. This command defines the VLAN to statically assign to the port if it acts as an access port, but the command does not prevent the switch from attempting to negotiate trunking on the port.\n\nThe remaining incorrect answers show commands that do not exist in Cisco switches.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

The switch hardware includes interfaces with interface IDs G1/0/1, G1/0/2, and so on, through G1/0/24. The exhibit lists output from the show vlan brief command. Which answers list facts that the output in the exhibit confirms? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "The answers come in pairs. Both pairs require you to know the logic IOS uses to decide which interfaces to list in the output from the command. In particular:\n\nThe command lists all interfaces with the interface\u0026#39;s configured access VLAN, whether up or down, except for interfaces in an up/up (connect) state and operating as a VLAN trunk.\n\nExamining the two answers about interface G1/0/8, the output lists that interface in the interface group for VLAN 3. That tells us the access VLAN configured for that interface (which confirms one correct answer.) However, G1/0/8 will appear in the output whether in a connected (up/up) or notconnect (down/down) state. So you cannot know the interface\u0026#39;s state by seeing the interface in this command\u0026#39;s output.\n\nFor the two answers that mention interface G1/0/17, note that the output does not list the interface. That means the interface currently operates as a trunk. That is, it has an operational state of trunking. The interface must therefore be working, making the one answer that mentions G1/0/17 correct and one incorrect.",

For example, if both switches use the switchport mode trunk command, they will trunk, regardless of whether DTP is enabled or disabled.\n\nFor the incorrect answer that mentions routers, note that routers do not negotiate trunking with DTP, so they do not use this command.",

The switches function as desired with the current configuration, which includes configuration for the ports connected to the PCs (not shown) as access ports in VLAN 11. The exhibit shows the configuration of the switches\u0026#39; trunk ports. Later, someone else connects to switch SW2 and adds these configuration commands:\n\n\ninterface range gi1/0/1-24,te1/1/1-2\n  switchport trunk native vlan 11\n\n\nWhich answer best describes the results of the new configuration? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "The question begins by describing working access ports in VLAN 11. It also references the exhibit, which shows a working VLAN trunk configuration that does not configure the native VLAN. As a result, the trunk uses default native VLAN 1.\n\nThe question then shows two additional commands which change the native VLAN setting on all switch SW2 ports shown in the figure (plus others) to VLAN 11. That creates an issue on the trunk. Switch SW1 uses the default native VLAN 1, while switch SW2 now uses native VLAN 11 per the new configuration. Mismatched native VLANs cause frames in the two VLANs on either side of the link to either (a) not flow across the trunk or (b) flow but hop (change) VLANs. Both are problems; the configuration should instead set the same native VLAN number on both ends of the trunk. So, the new configuration breaks the trunk.\n\nThe configuration also changes the native VLAN setting on switch SW2\u0026#39;s ports connected to the PCs, specifically G1/0/4 through G1/0/6. Those ports, as stated in the question stem, are access ports. Therefore, the native VLAN setting does not impact those ports\u0026#39; operation, making one answer correct. One incorrect answer claims that the native VLAN setting on those ports causes a native VLAN mismatch on those ports, and it does not because those ports are not trunks.",

One way of removing parallel paths is to make them into a single logical link, as with EtherChannel.\n\n\tIf there were only two switches, and they had parallel paths, STP would be needed to prevent the Layer 2 loop. Rapid Spanning Tree is still spanning tree, and that alone would not remove the need for it. Parallel paths can be created over access or trunk ports, and that alone would not remove the need for spanning tree.",

        "explanation":  "BPDU Filter is most commonly used at the access layer, particularly on edge or access ports that connect to end devices such as servers, workstations, or other non-bridge devices. The core and distribution layers are used for extremely fast movement of frames/packets and interconnecting other switches within the campus network, respectively. These are not where typical users have access to plug in a rogue switch, although anything is possible. Finally, Layer 3 uses routing and therefore doesn\u0026rsquo;t use STP at all.",

SW3 has no STP-related configuration commands. The hello received on Fa0/13 lists root cost 10, and the hello received on Gi0/1 lists root cost 20. Which of the following is true about STP on SW3?",
        "explanation":  "For a switch to determine its own root cost, the switch adds its received root cost (as advertised by neighbors) to the local switch\u0026#39;s interfaces. In this case, while the advertised cost is lower for the Hello SW3 receives on its Fa0/13 interface (cost 10), SW3 must then add the cost of F0/13. So SW3\u0026#39;s root cost out its F0/13 would be 29 (10 + 19). While the cost SW3 receives in the Hello coming in the GigabitEthernet link is 20, when SW3 adds the G0/1 cost to the link, SW3\u0026#39;s root cost out its G0/1 would be 24 (20 + 4). Because of this, SW3 will choose its Gi0/1 link as its root port.\n\n\tRegarding G0/1 becoming the designated port, it will not, because G0/1 is the root port.\n\n\tRegarding whether SW3\u0026rsquo;s Fa0/13 will become a designated port, we know that SW3 is receiving a Hello on F0/13 with root cost 10. SW3 would advertise it\u0026#39;s root cost as 24. The designated port is the port out which the least-cost Hello is advertised, so the other switch off SW3\u0026#39;s F0/13 port would win the election, and SW3\u0026#39;s F0/13 would not be the designated port.",

All three switches use RSTP, and they might also have other RSTP configuration settings not noted in the question. Which of the following statements about RSTP states and roles in this network are true?",
        "explanation":  "The alternate port role in RSTP serves as an alternate root port. The only requirement for a non-root port to be an alternate root port is to receive Hellos that identify the same root switch as the Hello received on the root port. In this RSTP topology, SW2\u0026rsquo;s Gi0/1 port will receive Hellos directly from SW3 (the root). SW2\u0026rsquo;s Gi0/2 must also receive Hellos identifying SW3 as root, based on the facts stated in the question and the diagram. As a result, SW2\u0026rsquo;s Gi0/1 port must be an RSTP alternate port.\n\nHowever, SW1 will not receive Hellos from SW2\u0026#39;s G0/2\u0026nbsp;port, as SW2\u0026#39;s G0/2\u0026nbsp;port is a root port. (Root ports expect to receive Hellos from the neighboring switch, but the switch does not forward Hellos out the root port.)\n\nAs for the two answers that mention a backup port,\u0026nbsp;none of the ports can\u0026nbsp;have a backup port role due to the current physical topology. To have a backup port with today\u0026#39;s Ethernet devices, one switch must connect more than one port to the same Ethernet segment, typically by connecting two ports to the same LAN hub. The figure shows no LAN hubs, so no ports can become backup ports.",

        "explanation":  "PortFast and BPDU Guard can be run independently. PortFast-enabled ports bypass the listening and learning states of STP and move into the forwarding state. If another switch is plugged into a PortFast protected port or any other port, BPDUs will be sent over that port. If BPDU Guard is enabled and a BPDU is detected, the port will be put into an err-disabled state. Trunk links are typically between more than one switch and would require the passing of BPDUs between the switches. Layer 3 routed ports do not participate in STP because STP is a Layer 2 construct.",

        "explanation":  "Root Guard is used to prevent unplanned switches from becoming the Root Bridge. Root Guard is configured on a port-by-port basis and listens to the BPDUs and determines whether the port receives a superior BPDU. If a superior BPDU is received, Root Guard prevents the election of a different root switch that is reachable through that port. Root Guard doesn\u0026rsquo;t forward superior BPDUs to another switch; it instead puts the port into what\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;root-inconsistent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; state until no superior BPDUs are being received in the hellos. Then the port automatically recovers back to a functioning state. Inferior BPDUs have no impact on Root Guard or the operational state of the port.",

The diagram identifies the root switch (switch SW1), and all root ports (RP) and designated ports (DP) for VLAN 10. All switches have the spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst command configured. The answers list ports that are neither root port nor designated port. Choose the answer that lists an RSTP port role that is meaningful for that port in this topology.",
        "explanation":  "The alternate port role acts as an alternate root port, while the backup port role serves as a backup designated port for a designated port on the same switch.\n\n\tFirst, for the answers that mention \u0026ldquo;backup port,\u0026rdquo; note that for a port to act as backup port, it must back up a designated port on that same switch. Also, that backup port must connect to the same collision domain. The collision domains include all the point-to-point links between switches and the links connected to the one LAN hub. Based on these facts, neither SW3 nor SW2 can have a backup port, because each does not connect with two ports to the same collision domain. However, switch SW4 does connect with two ports to the same collision domain (as created by the hub), so SW4 could use port F0/2 as an RSTP backup port.\n\n\tFor the alternate port concept, each nonroot switch can have an alternate (root) port. The alternate cannot also be serving in the designated port role or already be serving in the root port role. Based on those rules, SW3\u0026#39;s F0/4 and SW4\u0026#39;s G0/1 could both be the alternate port. (SW2\u0026rsquo;s port G0/2 could be an alternate port as well, but it is not listed as an answer.)\u0026nbsp;",

For SW3\u0026#39;s root port choice, SW3 calculates a root cost of 4 out of port G1/0/2 (towards SW2) and 8 out of port G1/0/1 (towards SW1.) As a result, SW3 uses its G1/0/2 port as its root port. Similarly, SW1\u0026nbsp;calculates a root cost of 4 out of port G1/0/2 (towards SW2) and 8 out of port G1/0/4\u0026nbsp;(towards SW4.) As a result, SW1\u0026nbsp;uses its G1/0/2 port as its root port.\n\nWith SW2 as the root switch, the most challenging question relates to the designated port choice on the link between SW1 and SW4. During convergence, both SW1 and SW4 forward Hellos onto the link. Both Hellos list SW2 as the root switch and a root cost of 4. Once both\u0026nbsp;realize that SW4\u0026#39;s G1/0/1 port wins the election to be the designated port on this link, SW1 ceases to send Hellos while SW4 continues.\n\nTo make the designated port decision on the SW1-SW4 link,\u0026nbsp;SW1 forwards a Hello to SW4 (out SW1\u0026#39;s G1/0/4 port) with cost 4.\u0026nbsp;SW4 forwards a cost 4\u0026nbsp;Hello out of its G1/0/1 port to SW1\u0026mdash;the Hellos tie because they both list the same root bridge ID and cost. The switches then look at the first tiebreaker: the lowest bridge ID between the switches sending the Hellos onto the link. SW4 has a lower BID, so it wins, making SW4\u0026#39;s G1/0/1 interface the designated port on the trunk between SW1 and SW4.\n\nWith STP, only the root creates Hellos when the network is stable, so SW3 would never create Hellos.

        "explanation":  "Loop Guard is used to prevent higher (poor) priority switches from moving their alternate or blocking ports to a forwarding state in the event of a unidirectional link failure. This typically occurs with fiber optic cable failures. This is when the device can\u0026rsquo;t detect the fiber failure and attempts to forward traffic down a link that can only send or receive traffic due to the broken fiber cable. When a Loop Guard\u0026ndash;enabled port stops receiving BPDUs from its upstream neighbor for a certain period, it places the port into a \u0026ldquo;loop-inconsistent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; state. The port stops forwarding traffic until it begins receiving BPDUs again from its upstream neighbor. This prevents the port from transitioning to the forwarding state due to a lack of BPDUs, which could lead to a forwarding loop if the network topology has changed. Designated and alternate ports cannot by definition become a root port.",

        "explanation":  "As for the correct answers, root ports (which exist only on nonroot switches) are in a forwarding state. Designated ports are also in a forwarding state. Additionally, an edge port with RSTP connects to a single non-switch device, meaning it will be the designated port, and therefore reach a forwarding state.\n\n\tAs for the incorrect answers, the RSTP backup and alternate port roles exist for a port to take over for some other designated port or root port, respectively. However, while in the backup or alternate role, the port is in a discarding state.\n\n\tAlso, for the answer that mentions \u0026quot;root ports on the root switch\u0026quot;, note that the root switch has no root port.",

The Gi0/2 interface has a \u0026lsquo;P\u0026rsquo; status, indicating that it is currently bundled in the port channel (working), while the Gi0/1 interface has a \u0026lsquo;w\u0026rsquo; status, indicating that it is currently waiting to be bundled (this happens if both sides of an interface are configured with a passive dynamic mode, in this case PAgP auto mode).",

When a host needs to send a packet, it can do some math based on its own IP address and mask to determine the IP addresses in the same subnet. If the destination is in the same subnet, by definition, no routers separate the hosts, so the sending host can send the packet directly to the destination host. However, if the destination is in a different subnet, the sending host knows it needs to send the packet to a router, because there will be at least one router between the sending host and the destination host.",

To define an entire classful  network, the mask must be the default mask for the network class of the address.  Two answers list class A addresses that begin with 10; neither uses the default  class A mask /8, so neither creates a route for the entire  classful network.  The answer with 172.16.1.1/16 uses the default mask for class B (/16), so it  would create a route for entire classful network 172.16.0.0. Similarly, the  answer showing 192.168.1.1/24 uses the default mask for class C networks, and  would create a route for classful network 192.168.1.0.",

        "explanation":  "IANA, the RIRs, and various ISPs assigned public address blocks to end-users. Public address refers to addresses and their address blocks that should be unique in the Internet. Routers in the Internet need IP routes to match those public addresses so that the routers can forward packets over the Internet to the correct location. \n\nIANA and the RIRs originally assigned three set sizes of public address blocks, called networks or classful networks. Those followed class A, B, and C rules and were of sizes 28, 216, and 224, respectively.\n\nThe above facts combine to give the reasoning behind the two correct answers. One incorrect answer refers to the sizes of CIDR blocks. IANA, the RIRs, and ISPs could assign any size block with a power of 2. That flexibility meant much less waste in assigning public addresses. \n\nThe answer that mentions reusing the addresses at many companies refers to a feature of private IP networks and does not apply to public IP networks or public CIDR blocks.\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "The information in the mask, plus the information implied by the address class, can be used to find the number of network bits, subnet bits, and host bits. These values in turn define the number of subnets that can be used with the subnetting design, and the number of host IP addresses per subnet. The address is in a class B network, and by definition, class B networks have 16 network bits, with the remaining 16 bits (on the right) being either subnet or host bits. The mask defines the dividing line between the subnet and host bits. With a mask of 255.255.254.0, which can be converted to /23. The prefix length (/23) is the sum of the network bits (16 in this case) and the subnet bits, so there must be 7 subnet bits. The number of host bits is simply 32 - prefix_length, or 9 in this case. The number of subnets in the network, assuming that single mask is used throughout, is 2^7 = 128. The number of hosts per subnet is 2^9 - 2 = 510.",

        "explanation":  "First, break down /29 into a four-octet math problem, using as many 8s on the left as possible. In this case, you can build a problem with 8 + 8 + 8 + something, which totals 24 so far. Of course, you need 5 more to total 29. So, 8 +8 + 8 + 5 represents the number of binary 1s in each octet of the DDN mask. Then, pick the DDN mask value for each octet based on your memory of the nine possible DDN mask values. In this case, you get 255.255.255.248. The octets of 255 each represent eight binary 1s, and the 248 represents five binary 1s and 3 binary 0s.The incorrect answers are just not the correct answer of 255.255.255.248.",

Because only the two IP addresses shown are needed, no waste occurs, but there are no additional IP addresses in the subnet. These facts rule out as incorrect the one answer that mentions the subnet for the serial link.\n\n\tOn the R3 LAN, the prefix of /28 implies a mask of 255.255.255.240 and 4 host bits. The formula for the number of hosts in a subnet is 2^4 minus 2, or a total of 14 hosts. With two host IP addresses already assigned 12 remain available for assignment. These facts rule out as incorrect the answer that references the R3 LAN subnet as having 28 available IP addresses but confirms as correct the answer that mentions that same LAN subnet has 12 available addresses.\n\n\tThe R1 LAN subnet uses a prefix of /23, which implies a mask of 255.255.254.0, and 9 host bits. The formula for the number of hosts in a subnet is 2^9 minus 2, or a total of 510 hosts, with two already used, leaving 508 more addresses in the subnet.

The routers have been configured with those IP addresses along with a routing protocol. All PCs can successfully ping each other, and all routers have been configured with the ip subnet-zero command. Which answers accurately describe the zero and broadcast subnets traversed in various pings between the PCs?",
        "explanation":  "In any subnetted network, the numerically lowest subnet ID is the zero subnet of that network. The name comes from the fact that in binary, the subnet bits have an all 0s value. In decimal, the zero subnet number always matches the classful network number. The zero subnets in the figure are:\n\n\n\tThe R4 LAN (172.30.0.0/21)\n\tThe R3 LAN\u0026nbsp;(10.0.0.0/14)\n\tThe R1-R2 WAN link (192.168.5.0/30)\n\n\nIn any subnetted network, the highest subnet ID is the broadcast subnet. The name comes from the coincidence that, in a\u0026nbsp;broadcast subnet, the subnet\u0026#39;s\u0026nbsp;subnet broadcast address is the same number as the network-wide broadcast address. Regardless, the broadcast subnets in the figure are:\n\n\n\tThe R1-R4\u0026nbsp;WAN link (192.168.7.128/25)\n\n\nFor instance, the subnet number on the R1-R4 link is 192.168.7.128, with a range of valid addresses 192.168.7.129 to .254, with 192.168.7.255 as the subnet broadcast address. The network-wide broadcast has 255 in the last octet of Class C\u0026mdash;in other words, 192.168.7.255. Therefore, the R1-R4 link is a broadcast subnet. It is the only broadcast subnet in the figure.\n\nFinally, note that the\u0026nbsp;R1-R3 WAN link does not use subnetting because it uses class C addresses with the default class C mask of /24.\n\nPredict the path messages take between any pair of PCs to find the correct answers. Then you can look at the above analysis to see if those packets traversed any zero or broadcast subnets.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

The addresses and subnets per the figure have already been implemented. You must add a LAN subnet from within that same address range that supports up to 30 hosts. If more than one subnet meets those criteria, you must use the numerically lowest subnet ID. Which answer meets all these requirements?",
        "explanation":  "To solve this question, first, you need to identify the range of addresses in the four existing subnets, as listed here:\n\n\n\tR1\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.72/29 with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.79.\n\tR2\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.128/26\u0026nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.191.\n\tR3\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.16/28\u0026nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.31.\n\tR4\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.96/27\u0026nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.127.\n\n\nNext, you must identify a mask providing 30 hosts/subnet. A mask of /27 leaves 5 host bits, implying 25 - 2 or 30 hosts/subnet, providing the exact number of addresses needed. A mask of /28 (as per two answers) needs to supply more hosts per subnet, with only 4 host bits.\n\nThen, calculate the possible subnets in this address range using the /27 mask. Those include:\n\n\n\t172.16.100.0/27 (subnet broadcast .31)\n\t172.16.100.32/27 (subnet broadcast .63)\n\t172.16.100.64/27 (subnet broadcast .95)\n\t172.16.100.96/27 (subnet broadcast .127)\n\t...\n\n\nFinally, comparing the lists, which possible new subnet with a /27 mask does not overlap with an existing subnet? Comparing the two lists, the first subnet (172.16.100.0/27) overlaps, but the next one (172.16.100.32/27) does not, making that subnet the correct answer.",

        "explanation":  "Fa0/1 is in an \u0026quot;up/down\u0026quot; state, which generally refers to Layer 2 problems. For the answer that suggests the adjacent switch interface shut down, if that were the case, R1 would not see any electrical signals on the cable, so R1 would instead place the interface in a \u0026quot;down/down\u0026quot; state, implying\u0026nbsp;a physical layer problem. S0/0/0 has a shutdown command configured, so there is no way to know whether the actual link has any Layer 1, Layer 2, or Layer 3 problems. S0/0/1 does not have an IP address assigned,\u0026nbsp;but the lack of an IP address would not cause the \u0026quot;down/down\u0026quot; status, so some other problem (probably related to Layer 1) exists.\u0026nbsp;For S0/1/0, which is in an\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;up/down\u0026quot; state, the state implies a Layer 2 issue, so the mismatched configuration of Layer 2 protocols would be\u0026nbsp;one reason for the problem.",

        "questionText":  "All routers and interfaces in the figure work. The text below shows the only current IP route for subnet 172.16.30.192/26 in router R1. At that point, an engineer configures the command ip route 172.16.30.192 255.255.255.192 172.16.13.3 120 on router R1. Which answer describes how router R1 processes the command?\n\n\nR1# show ip route\n! Lines omitted for brevity\n      172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks\nO        172.16.30.192/26 [110/3] via 172.16.12.2, 00:04:56, GigabitEthernet0/0/1",
        "explanation":  "This question revolves around the administrative distance of the existing route and the route defined in the ip route command as a classic example of a floating static route. Per the output in the exhibit, the existing route has an administrative distance of 110. The route also has a code that means it is an OSPF interarea route, and OSPF uses a default administrative distance of 110. So the route appears to have been learned by OSPF. The ip route command in the question ends with 120, which is the administrative distance applied to the route in the command.\n\nAdditionally, note that the existing route defines a route to subnet 172.16.30.192, mask /26. The /26 mask is equivalent to mask 255.255.255.192, the mask used in the ip route command. So both the existing route and the route in the ip route command refer to the same subnet.\n\nIOS accepts the configuration command, adding it to the running-config file, because there are no syntax or value errors in the command. Because the command uses a higher administrative distance, IOS does not add a route to the routing table. If the router ever loses the OSPF route to that subnet, IOS would add a route based on this configured static route.",

The design uses OSPF over the Ethernet WAN link. What command enables you to configure a floating static route on the branch router to the 200.200.200.0/24 network should the primary link fail?",
        "explanation":  "A floating static route is a method that is used to add a static route to the routing table should an existing better route disappear. This usually happens when the main routing protocol that is used is cut off from a spoke/branch. When the device sees that the routing protocol route has been removed from the routing table, it inserts the static route (thus the floating). In this case, the 200.200.200.0/24 network exists off of the central router. To back it up, a route must be added that points the routing for this prefix through the central backup router. (A similar action is done at the central location, as well, to ensure that a return route exists).\n\n\tNote that the administrative distance of the floating static route in this case needed to be a higher number than 110, the default administrative distance used by OSPF. Of the three incorrect answers, Two give an administrative distance less than 110, so that the static route would be in the routing table even when OSPF was learning a route for the same subnet. Also, two of the incorrect answers point to the wrong next-hop router (50.50.50.1 and 100.100.100.2), so they would not be used.",

To accept the command into the configuration, it must have correct syntax. Also, the two numeric parameters must pass a test in which the first number is a subnet ID when using the configured mask, rather than being an address or a subnet broadcast address. IOS would reject the command if the first numeric value was not a subnet ID.\n\nOnce in the configuration, IOS would not add the route to the routing table if:\n\n\n\tA better route (with a lower administrative distance) already exists in the routing table\n\tThe static route\u0026rsquo;s next-hop address (if configured) is not reachable by the router.\n\tThe static route\u0026rsquo;s outgoing interface (if configured) is not in an up/up state.\n\n\nOnly one of those reasons appears in the answers and is the correct answer in this case. R1 would not have a connected route matching next-hop address 10.4.12.2 if the link between the routers were down, for instance.\n\nFor the incorrect answer that mentions the lack of an administrative distance parameter, that parameter is optional, defaulting to 1, and the command is fine without that parameter.\n\nFor the answer claiming that the first numeric parameter is not a subnet ID, it is incorrect. You can do the math on the values in the ip route command to confirm that fact. However, the question tells you the router accepted the command and added it to the configuration, which confirms that the router thinks the values are acceptable.\n\nFinally, one answer claims that the subnet listed by the command is not the subnet connected to router R2. That claim is not true; it is the subnet listed off R2 in the figure. However, even if the ip route command referred to a non-existent subnet, it would still add the route to the routing table.

        "explanation":  "First, the terminology can get in the way when discussing VLANs and VLAN interfaces. A VLAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain. The configuration defines the VLAN with the vlan vlan-id global command. Access ports have an assigned access VLAN, while trunk ports support many VLANs. The term VLAN interface refers to a switch\u0026#39;s layer 3 interface that connects to the VLAN, on which the switch configuration can include an IP address. The configuration creates such an interface with the interface vlan vlan-id global command.\n\nThe question asks about the state of two VLAN interfaces, with the question text ending by noting that both VLAN interfaces have been configured with the no autostate command. As a result, the only check IOS performs to control the state of the VLAN interfaces is whether the VLAN exists or not. IOS does not check the several other factors that it would check if the interfaces used the default setting of autostate, which includes:\n\n\n\tAt least one working physical interface in that VLAN, including access VLANs and trunks that include the VLAN in the allowed VLAN list.\n\tThe VLAN (not the VLAN interface, but the VLAN) must be defined and active (not shutdown).\n\tThe VLAN interface must not be shutdown.\n\n\nThe actions detailed in the question do not delete either VLAN 11 or VLAN 12, so with autostate disabled, both VLAN interfaces remain in an up/up state.",

The show ip interface brief command lists interface VLAN100 at the end of the output. VLAN100 is a Switched Virtual Interface, or SVI - another name for a VLAN interface. Per that output, SVI (VLAN interface 100) is in a down/down state.\n\n\tSeveral issues can cause a switch to list a VLAN interface in a down/down state. Or stated positively, the following must be true for an SVI to be in an up/up state:\n\n\t\n\t\tThe corresponding VLAN must exist on the switch\n\t\n\t\tThe corresponding VLAN (VLAN 100 in this case) must be active (that is, not shutdown)\n\t\n\t\tAt least one access interface must be configured to be in the corresponding VLAN, OR... a operational trunk interface exists and the VLAN is included in the trunk\u0026#39;s allowed list\n\t\n\t\tThe SVI (the VLAN interface) must be enabled, that is, not shutdown\n\n\n\tIf any of the first three conditions are not true, the SVI lands in a down/down state. If the SVI is shutdown, the switch places the SCI into an administratively down state.\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tFor this scenario, the exhibit shows that VLAN 100, per the show vlan brief command, is in an act/lshut state, meaning that the VLAN (not the VLAN interface, but the VLAN) has been shutdown. As a result, the switch places the matching VLAN interface into a down/down state.",

An engineer connects to the switch and issues two sets of new configuration commands. First, they issue shutdown command in interface G1/0/2 configuration mode. Next, they issue the shutdown command in VLAN 12 configuration mode. Both VLAN interfaces use the default autostate setting. Which answer best describes the new state of the two VLAN interfaces?\n\n\nSW1# show interfaces status\nPort      Name           Status       Vlan       Duplex  Speed Type \nGi1/0/1                  connected    11         a-full  a-100 10/100/1000BaseTX\nGi1/0/2                  connected    11           auto   auto 10/100/1000BaseTX\nGi1/0/3                  connected    12         a-full  a-100 10/100/1000BaseTX\nGi1/0/4                  connected    12         a-full  a-100 10/100/1000BaseTX",
        "explanation":  "First, the terminology can get in the way when discussing VLANs and VLAN interfaces. A VLAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain. The configuration defines the VLAN with the vlan vlan-id global command. Access ports have an assigned access VLAN, while trunk ports support many VLANs. The term VLAN interface refers to a switch\u0026#39;s layer 3 interface that connects to the VLAN, on which the switch configuration can include an IP address. The configuration creates such an interface with the interface vlan vlan-id global command.\n\nThe question asks about the state of two VLAN interfaces, with the question text ending by noting that both VLAN interfaces use the autostate setting (the default.) As a result, the interfaces require several states to be good for the VLAN interface to be up/up, including:\n\n\n\tAt least one working physical interface in that VLAN, including access VLANs and trunks that include the VLAN in the allowed VLAN list.\n\tThe VLAN (not the VLAN interface, but the VLAN) must be defined and active (not shutdown).\n\tThe VLAN interface must not be shutdown.\n\n\nThe question tells us that both VLAN interfaces are initially in an up/up state, so at that point, all these criteria must be true. For the VLAN 11 interface, the new configuration disables one physical link (G1/0/2), but interface G1/0/1, also in VLAN 11 per the exhibit, remains active. So that action does not cause interface VLAN 11 to fail.\n\nThe second new configuration item disables VLAN 12 with the shutdown command. As a result, IOS disables the associated VLAN 12 interface. So, the correct answer notes that interface VLAN 11 remains up, but that interface VLAN 12 fails.",

R1 also has eight switched interfaces, numbered G0/1/0 \u0026ndash; G0/1/7, each connected to a PC. Router R1 acts as the default router for all PCs. In which configuration mode would you expect to see configuration for the IP address R1 uses as the default router for those PCs?",
        "explanation":  "When using a router with LAN switch ports, the router configuration mimics the configuration in a layer 3 switch. That configuration includes layer 2 settings on the physical interfaces, for instance, setting a VLAN ID with the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface subcommand. To configure IP settings, you configure a VLAN interface for each VLAN used on those embedded switch ports. \n\nTo create the VLAN interface, use the interface vlan vlan-id command. That command moves the CLI into VLAN interface config mode, where you can configure the ip address command to configure the router\u0026#39;s IP address on that interface. The PCs in that VLAN will use that address as their default router setting.\n\nThe above facts detail why the correct answer is correct. For the incorrect answers:\n\n\n\tInterfaces G0/0/0 and G0/0/1 will have ip address commands configured, but those will not define the IP address of the default router used by the PCs.\u0026nbsp; \n\tIf in configuration mode for any of the switched ports (G0/1/0 \u0026ndash; G0/1/7), IOS would reject the ip address command because the port is incapable of layer 3 features.\n\tThe answer that mentions subinterfaces implies a router-on-a-stick (ROAS) configuration due to its use of subinterfaces. Routers use ROAS configuration on a routed Ethernet interface, which is not the case described in the question.",

To process the native VLAN with the physical interface, you would simply give the physical interface an IP address, as is shown here. However, the encapsulation dot1q 30 native subcommnand tells the router to process the native VLAN\u0026#39;s traffic on the matching subinterface. A correct configuration should do one or the other, but not both.\n\nFinally, the VLAN assignment commands (encapsulation dot1q) that are configured on subinterfaces Gi0/0.200 and Gi0/0.300 are reversed; this would cause traffic to be handled by the wrong subinterfaces in comparison to the figure.

        "questionText":  "Examine the exhibit, which shows output taken from a router. Which answers describe correct conclusions about the two interfaces in the exhibit supported by the output? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "Over their long history, most router interfaces behaved like router interfaces. However, eventually, Cisco began offering router hardware that integrated router and switch features. Over time, Cisco added small sets of LAN switch ports for some router models. In Cisco\u0026#39;s implementation of these interfaces, Cisco refers to interfaces that behave like traditional router interfaces as routed interfaces or routed ports, and the interfaces that act like LAN-switched ports are called switched interfaces or switched ports.\n\nIdentifying the routed and switched ports can be challenging. On Cisco routers, the interface cannot change from one to the other once you order and receive the router. Instead, you can order Cisco routers, and depending on the model, they may have only routed interfaces, or they may also include some switched interfaces. \n\nYou can identify the type of port from the configuration: routed ports support the ip address subcommand (while switch ports do not, and switched ports support only layer 2 configuration commands, like the switchport access vlan command, while routed ports do not. Based on these facts, the ip address command under interface G0/0/0 confirms the interface is a routed port, and the presence of the switchport access vlan command under interface G0/1/4 confirms it is a switched port.\n\nAs a result, When using a router with LAN switch ports, the router configuration mimics the configuration in a layer 3 switch. That configuration includes layer 2 settings on the physical interfaces, for instance, setting a VLAN ID with the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface subcommand. To configure IP settings, you configure a VLAN interface for each VLAN used on those embedded switch ports. \n\nTo create the VLAN interface, use the interface vlan vlan-id command. That command moves the CLI into VLAN interface config mode, where you can configure the ip address command to configure the router\u0026#39;s IP address on that interface. The PCs in that VLAN will use that address as their default router setting.",

        "explanation":  "When Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) is configured on a router, the encapsulation command is used on a router\u0026rsquo;s Ethernet subinterface to associate it with a specific VLAN. The addition of the native keyword at the end will treat the specific VLAN as native for the interface and all the subinterfaces. This means that all frames that are received without an IEEE 802.1q tag will be routed to this interface (or subinterface). In this case, to associate a subinterface with the VLAN 200 and enable it to handle untagged frames, use the encapsulation dot1q 200 native command, which would be used while in subinterface configuration mode. It is important to be aware that by configuring this interface as native, all untagged frames that are received will be considered and processed as VLAN 200 traffic.",

The Request message is a message sent by the client to ask the server to assign the offered address. The Acknowledgment message is sent by the server acknowledging the client\u0026rsquo;s request and providing the mask, default router, and DHCP server settings, among other DHCP information.\n\nBased on these facts, the Request message\u0026#39;s purpose matches the statement in the question.

Consider the output below from router R1. Which answers list a configuration command you could expect to exist in router R1? (Choose three answers.)\n\n\nR1# ping web\nType escape sequence to abort.\nSending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.25.2.103, timeout is 2 seconds:\n!!!!!\nSuccess rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms",
        "explanation":  "First, the output in the exhibit shows that the ping command is working and that the command sends packets to address 172.25.2.103 \u0026ndash; the web server\u0026#39;s address. So, it appears that router R1 resolved the name into the correct IP address.\n\nNext, note that the example shows the ping command from the CLI of router R1 rather than some host. That means the question asks about settings that impact DNS client functions on the router, so the question asks about the router\u0026#39;s configuration. The question also states that the engineer building the lab network wants to use the DNS shown in the lab with domain example.com. Those facts combine to require these configuration settings on the router:\n\n\nip domain lookup\nip name-server 172.25.2.102\nip domain name example.com\n\n\n\nThe commands, in order, enable the following features:\n\n\n\tAct as a DNS client, that is, send DNS name queries\n\tSend DNS requests to one name server at 172.25.2.102.\n\tAppend example.com as the domain name to DNS requests that do not use fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs)\n\n\nAside: In past IOS versions, these commands had slightly different syntax: ip domain-lookup, ip domain-name. The above configuration, without hyphens, shows the more recent and still-current IOS syntax.\n\nAs for the incorrect answers:\n\n\n\tThe ip host command configures a local hostname on the router for hostname web, which is not needed because the router is using DNS.\n\tThe no ip domain lookup command disables the DNS client function on the router, which is the opposite of the intent for this question.\n\tThe ip dns command shown in one answer is not an IOS command.",

        "explanation":  "Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:\n\n\t\n\t\tOn-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.\n\t\n\t\tBroad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.\n\t\n\t\tResource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.\n\t\n\t\tRapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different than an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity it\u0026rsquo;s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.\n\t\n\t\tMeasured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.\n\n\n\tBoth agile network access and proactive service are unrelated to a cloud service offering and refer to business architecture principals.",

The LSAs each contain the detailed data about the LSA.\n\tLink-State Database Descriptor (DD): Used by a router after becoming a neighbor, but before sending LSUs, to send a summary list of LSAs to a neighbor. The routers use the lists in the DD message as part of the process of deciding which LSAs it should exchange with LSU packets.\n\tThree answers describe the function of the DD message, with the one describing how DD messages list the known LSAs being the correct answer.\n\n\tTwo answers mention the timing of the use of DD packets. These packets occur after routers become neighbors, but before (and in preparation for) sending LSU packets.",

The OSPF **network** command can use any wildcard mask that works. The command\u0026rsquo;s goal is to match interfaces, and once matched, IOS enables OSPF on the matched interfaces and assigns them to the area as noted in the command. So, you can invert the subnet mask to come up with a wildcard mask to use in the network command. But you can use any other wildcard mask as well. Then IOS determines the range of addresses as computed from the address and wildcard mask in the network command, compares that range to all interfaces on the router, and for those matched, enables OSPF. So, you asked \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; - there\u0026rsquo;s no should or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, just what is, and then the job is to figure out which interfaces are matched by which network commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tNow, if I were configuring OSPF in a real network, would I pick a convention, and use it on all routers? Yes. Might I invert the subnet mask like you did as the convention? Perfectly reasonable.

        "questionText":  "Her boss asks a junior engineer to suggest a single OSPF network command to use on router R1 in the figure. The goal: match all three interfaces with the one network command. The command must also follow all command conventions so that IOS will not change the command when the engineer adds it to the configuration. Which answer meets all the requirements?",
        "explanation":  "The question requires that the command not be changed by IOS when added to the router configuration. In some cases, IOS will change the subnet value (the first value) in the OSPF network command when you add it to the configuration. By convention, the first numeric value must be the numerically lowest number in the range defined by the combined subnet plus wildcard fields. If not, IOS changes your value to the lowest number in the range. \n\nFor instance, in this case, the network 172.16.30.1 0.0.0.255 area 0 command defines a range with the idea of \u0026quot;all addresses that begin 172.16.30\u0026quot;. Numerically, the range is 172.16.30.0 \u0026ndash; 172.16.30.255. However, with an initial value of 172.16.30.1, which is not the number at the low end of the range, IOS would change the command to network 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.\n\nTwo incorrect answers have values in the subnet field that would result in IOS changing the command, making them incorrect based on the wording of this question:\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.1 0.0.0.255\u0026hellip; becomes network 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255\u0026hellip;\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.1 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip; becomes network 172.16.30.0 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip;\n\nFor the two remaining answers, one creates an address range that includes all three interfaces, and one matches only two interfaces, not matching interface G0/0/0\u0026#39;s IP address. You can easily find the range of values matched by the network command. Once in the configuration file, the command has the number at the low end of the range as the first value. You simply add the two values (subnet and wildcard mask) to find the high end of the range. In this case:\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255\u0026hellip; has a range of: 172.16.30.0 \u0026ndash; 172.16.30.255\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.0 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip; has a range of: 172.16.30.0 \u0026ndash; 172.16.31.255\n\nBased on comparing those ranges to the interface addresses, only the network 172.16.30.0 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip; command matches all three interfaces.",

        "explanation":  "The show ip protocols command reveals information about both the network subcommands in OSPF mode and the ip ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommands. First, under the heading \u0026quot;Routing for Networks,\u0026quot; the output lists one line for each network command \u0026ndash; it just omits the word \u0026quot;network.\u0026quot; In this case, the output lists only one line, so router R1 has only one network command (network 10.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0).\n\nThe output also lists the interfaces with the ip ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommands under the heading \u0026quot;Routing on Interfaces Configured Explicitly (Area 0):\u0026quot;. The output includes a heading line like this for interfaces in each area, so with only one such heading line, this router only assigns interfaces to area 0 with this command. With three interfaces in the list, you can confirm the subcommand exists on three interfaces.\n\nOne incorrect answer, ip ospf 0 area 1, swaps the area number (0) and the OSPF process ID (1). The correct answer, ip ospf 1 area 0, lists them in the correct location.\n\nRegarding OSPF neighbors, using the show ip ospf neighbor command works much better. Still, this command at least identifies the OSPF RID of all neighbors under the heading \u0026quot;Routing Information Sources.\u0026quot; In this case, R1 has neighbor relationships with three other routers, with RIDs 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3, and 4.4.4.4.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "The formula to calculate OSPF costs, which is used when the ip ospf cost command is not configured on an interface, is 10^8 / bandwidth. The auto-cost command value defaults to a setting of 100, meaning 100 Mbps, which is equal to 10^8, and is the numerator of the formula. Therefore, an auto-cost reference-bandwidth 100 command simply sets the value to its default setting. In contrast, auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000 increases the numerator in the formula by a factor of 10.",

However, the question states that all the routers just rebooted, so there should be no BDR to take over for the DR. As worded, the question creates a scenario where all routers compete equally to become DR.\n\n\tThe routers choose the router with the highest OSPF interface priority, and if a tie, they then use the router with the highest router ID. In this case, the answers show routers with different priorities, so no ties exist based on priority. As a result, R1, with the highest priority (4), becomes the DR.",

        "explanation":  "The\u0026nbsp;default-information originate\u0026nbsp;command advertises a default route throughout the OSPF domain. A working default route must exist on the router with the\u0026nbsp;default-information originate\u0026nbsp;command for the command to work correctly. R3 meets this requirement using a default static route to 192.0.2.1, an address located off R3\u0026#39;s G0/1 interface. R3 then advertises a default route into the OSPF domain as an external route. As OSPF propagates the route from router to router, each router alters the next-hop to reflect the next upstream router\u0026#39;s address. For instance, R3 would advertise a default route with a next-hop of 10.10.10.1, and R2 would advertise it with a next-hop of 20.20.20.1. As a result, the default route on router R1 will list 20.20.20.1 as its next-hop address.",

With the configuration shown, the routers all use the IP addresses on their loopback interfaces as router ID. (Note that none of the routers configured their RIDs directly.) As a result of R4 having the numerically-highest RID, R4 becomes DR. R3, with the next highest RID, becomes the BDR.\n\n\tNote that the addition of a new router to the LAN (R1) does not cause the routers to elect a new DR or BDR. Only the failure of a DR or BDR on the LAN causes a new election.",

Some misconfigurations and operational status values would prevent R1 from listing R2\u0026#39;s OSPF router ID in the show ip ospf command output.\u0026nbsp; Which answers list such a configuration or status? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "Some misconfiguration and status issues do not cause a problem for OSPF neighbors. Others cause a problem so that a router does not list the potential neighbor as a neighbor in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command. Some other problems prevent the neighbor relationship from working correctly, but the neighbor appears in the command output. This question reviews some of the reasons for each category.\n\nThe correct answers identify configuration or status that confirms that R1 and R2 will not have an OSPF neighbor relationship and that router R1 does not list R2\u0026#39;s RID in the list of neighbors. In this case, the answer configuring R1\u0026#39;s Hello interval to 15 seconds, with R2\u0026#39;s remaining at the default of 10, prevents the neighbor relationship from forming. The other correct answer stops all OSPF processing on R2\u0026#39;s WAN link due to the ip ospf shutdown interface subcommand. The no shutdown command configured just afterward does not change the ip ospf shutdown setting. As described, the configuration enables the link but disables all OSPF processing on the link.\n\nAll the incorrect answers refer to conditions that do not result in any problem at all. Specifically:\n\n\n\tOne answer states that the configuration assigns both ends of the link to the same area, which is a requirement, and does not cause a problem.\n\tR1 defaults to using OSPF network type broadcast (because the interface is an Ethernet type interface), while the R2 configuration overtly configures the same setting. Neighbor relationships work with this same setting on both ends of the link.\n\tNeighboring OSPF routers can use different OSPF process IDs but must use different router IDs, and the remaining incorrect answer shows different values on R1 versus R2 for both.",

Both will be stable and remain in the table. By default, the router will load balance traffic across the two routes on a destination-by-destination basis.",

The two configuration lines below exist on all three routers, with no other non-default OSPF settings on any of the three routers. As a result, R1 lists two neighbor relationships.

        "explanation":  "The configuration enables OSPF on all interfaces and assigns them to area 0 per the configured network command.

For each answer, you need to decide if the configuration change would impact R1\u0026#39;s neighbor relationship with either R2 or R3, with the correct answers being those that cause a problem. Working through the correct answers:\n\n\n\tThe answer that changes R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 Hello interval to 11, instead of the default used by neighbor R2 of 10, causes the existing neighbor relationship to fail. Neighbors must use the same Hello and Dead intervals. \n\tThe answer with the ip ospf shutdown interface subcommand on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 interface disables all OSPF processing. As a result, R1\u0026#39;s neighbor relationship with R2 fails.\n\tThe answer that describes an inbound ACL on router R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/2 interface, which filters all OSPF Hello messages, causes the neighbor relationships on that interface to fail. OSPF uses the continual receipt of Hello messages to indicate that the neighbor is still up and working.\n\n\nAs for the incorrect answers \u0026ndash; those that do not cause a problem:\n\n\n\tAll the routers use Ethernet-type interfaces, which use a default broadcast network type. The ip ospf network broadcast command just reconfigures the default setting and does not make a change.\n\tThe answer with the ip ospf shutdown interface subcommand on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 interface disables all OSPF processing. However, R1 has no OSPF neighbors off that interface, so the configuration change does not result in any neighbor failures, making this answer incorrect for this question.",

        "explanation":  "Two two correct answers do list two separate reasons why two routers would not become OSPF neighbors.\n\t\n\tAs for the wrong answers, the dead intervals must match for the routers to become neighbors, and the dead interval defaults to four times the Hello interval, but the dead interval does not have to be four times the Hello interval. Next, the network commands on the two routers do not have to match in any way at all; the only requirement is that both routers have OSPF enabled on the interfaces somehow. Finally, OSPF uses interface IP addresses and multicast addresses as the source and destination of OSPF packets, often which do not happen to be the OSPF RID, so an ACL that matches the RID would not necessarily stop OSPF from working.",

With OSPF, the routers attempt to become neighbors, listing each other for a time in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command. However, the neighbor relationship fails due to the MTU mismatch, so the routers remove the neighbor table entry. The routers repeat this process over and over.\n\nThe routers fail to exchange any LSAs, so they add no routes.

With a single area, those routes appear in R1\u0026#39;s routing table with code O, as noted with the correct answer that lists subnet 10.1.3.0/24. A different (incorrect) answer lists code O for subnet 10.1.12.0/30. That subnet connects to one of router R1\u0026#39;s interfaces, so it would not be an OSPF-learned route, but rather a connected route on router R1 (with code C.)\u0026nbsp;\n\nFor router R1\u0026#39;s four interfaces, the router will list a connected route for each subnet, each with code C. Those facts confirm the correct answer that shows code C with subnet 10.1.1.0/24.\u0026nbsp;\n\nFinally, a router adds a local route (code L) for the specific interface address, with prefix length /32, for each working interface. None of the correct answers lists code L with a /32 prefix length.\n\nThe incorrect answer that lists code D is incorrect because D refers to EIGRP-learned routes, and the network does not use EIGRP.",

        "explanation":  "Some misconfiguration and status issues do not cause a problem for OSPF neighbors. Others cause a problem so that a router does not list the potential neighbor as a neighbor in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command. Some other problems prevent the neighbor relationship from working correctly, but the neighbor appears in the command output. This question reviews some of the reasons for each category.\n\nThe correct answers identify configuration or status that confirms that R1 and R2 will not have an OSPF neighbor relationship and that router R1 does not list R2\u0026#39;s RID in the list of neighbors. All routers on the same link/subnet must be in the same OSPF area, and one answer describes configuration that places the ends of the link in different areas. The other correct answer describes an allowed case of both routers using OSPF Process ID 1, but a disallowed case of both routers using the same router ID (1.1.1.1.) \n\nFor the incorrect answers, two refer to conditions that do not result in any problem at all. Both require that you recall some default settings. First, R1 uses 9 for priority, and R2 defaults to use 1. The numbers can be the same or different; the priority values only cause a failure if you set both to 0. The answer with the ip ospf dead-interval 40 interface subcommand sets the configuration value to the same value as the default setting on the other router, so that does not cause a problem.\n\nFinally, one incorrect answer is incorrect because, although it does cause a problem, R1 does display R2\u0026#39;s RID in the neighbor table. In that case, the two routers become neighbors and exchange LSAs, but they cannot build routes based on those LSAs due to the network type mismatch.",

        "explanation":  "All the OSPF routes in the IP routing table represent different subnets. In some cases, the address ranges represented by each route overlap. As a result, some destination addresses might match multiple routes. The router then uses a longest-match or most-specific match choice. In other words, it uses the route with the largest prefix mask among the matched routes. \n\nIn this case, the address ranges of the routes are:\n\n\n\t0.0.0.0/0 \u0026ndash; All addresses\n\t10.10.200.210 \u0026ndash; That address only\n\t10.10.192.0 \u0026ndash; 10.10.207.255 \n\t10.10.200.0 \u0026ndash; 10.10.203.255\n\t10.10.208.0 \u0026ndash; 10.10/208.31\n\n\nAmong the five routes, 10.10.206.200 matches the first and third routes in the list. That analysis reveals why, among the three answers that list subnets, the one that the packet matches and the two it does not.\n\nOnly one can be correct for the three answers that list the interface the router forwards the packet out. Comparing the two routes that the packet matches, the third route has the longer mask (/20 version /0). So, the router uses the route to 10.10.192.0/20, which lists G0/0/2 as the outgoing interface. That fact confirms the other correct answer and rules out two other answers as incorrect.",

Consecutive groups of 0000s can be omitted and represented by a ::, but only one time per IPv6 address (normally used on the section that has the greatest amount of consecutive groups of 0s).\n\n\tAbbreviating an IPv6 address doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it backward-compatible with IPv4 addresses. Trailing 0s are placeholders, which can\u0026rsquo;t be removed without changing the rest of the bit values in the respective grouping. The :: technique, if used more than a single time in an IPv6 address, would be ambiguous and isn\u0026rsquo;t an allowed option.",

        "explanation":  "Like IPv4 hosts, IPv6 hosts need to know the Layer 2 Ethernet address of another host in the same subnet, but not for hosts in another subnet. The question states that host B is in a different Ethernet VLAN, so it will be in a different IPv6 subnet than host A, with (at least) one router or layer 3 switch between host A\u0026#39;s subnet and host B\u0026#39;s subnet. As a result, host A never needs to learn host B\u0026#39;s MAC address.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers... ARP is an IPv4 protocol to learn a local device\u0026rsquo;s Layer 2 address and isn\u0026rsquo;t used in IPv6. NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is used to learn Layer 2 Ethernet addresses when needed, but only functions within the same VLAN. OSPFv3 is a routing protocol used by routers, so it does learn information about other IPv6 subnets - routes to those subnets - but it isn\u0026rsquo;t a protocol to learn the Layer 2 address of a neighbor.",

Which of the following networks would you use for your pilot program?",
        "explanation":  "Unique Local Addresses (ULAs), like Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs), support grouping addresses into subnets and IPv6 routing. They differ in that ULAs rely on a random self-assignment of the prefix to use, while GUAs require an administrative process to ask for and be assigned a globally-unique prefix. Also, the Internet does not allow packets to or from ULAs, as they may not be unique in the Internet due to the prefix self-assignment process. Considering these facts, the question drives us towards using ULA while ensuring each partner company uses a unique ULA prefix. ULA addresses begin with FD.\n\nFor the incorrect answers, Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) begin with FE80, multicast addresses with FF, and Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs) with 2 or 3.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "A company uses global unicast addresses (GUAs) for hosts. For a few router functions, they also use IPv6 anycast addresses. Which answer best describes the IPv6 anycast address to use?",
        "explanation":  "With IPv6 anycast, multiple routers configure the same IPv6 unicast address as an interface address. Each router advertises a route for that address. For any endpoints that attempt to send a packet to that address, the routers forward the packet based on the best route. As a result, the packet arrives at one of the routers that implement the anycast address. With this model, you can implement services so that the nearest router supplies the service without the user of the service being aware of multiple routers providing the service.\n\nIPv6 does not use a reserved address range, as suggested in two answers. Instead, it uses any unicast address you might otherwise use in the network but one not in any deployed subnet. As for the other incorrect answer, the router does not calculate the anycast address from a MAC address.",

        "explanation":  "The solicited-node multicast address is used to send traffic to a limited subnet of local devices. One common user is the IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) process. The RFC specifies that the first 104 bits of the address are always FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001:FF, with the last 24 bits coming from a device\u0026rsquo;s IPv6 address. This means that for a device to use the FF02::1:FFE0:8 solicited-node multicast address, the last 24 bits (6 hex digits) of the configured address must be E0.0008. The only answer matching this is the 2500:AB83:EBAC:9134:C801:1AFF:FEE0:0008 address.",

        "explanation":  "First, note that the router accepts the ipv6 enable interface subcommand regardless of whether the router has enabled IPv6 routing. That fact rules out one answer as incorrect.\n\nThe other answers list variations of possible Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) that router R1 might create dynamically based on the configured values. The one correct answer lists the correct LLA. It begins with FE80 and three quartets of 0000. It shows the separated values of 000011 and 111111 from the MAC address. And it shows the effect of inverting the seventh bit of the MAC address, so the first six hex digits of the MAC address become 020011. Finally, it shows FFFE in the middle of the interface ID. All those facts combine to support FE80::200:11FF:FE11:1111 as the correct LLA.\n\nThe other incorrect answers have these issues:\n\n\n\tOne lists the same address but in unabbreviated form. The question asked for the abbreviated address.\n\tOne lists the same address without inverting the seventh bit of the MAC address.\n\tOne lists the correct value except for using FF instead of FE as the first two digits.",

From the beginning digit of 2, you can tell that the address comes from the global unicast range.\n\nFor the incorrect answers, the ipv6 address command would need the eui-64 keyword to dynamically cause the router to form the interface ID portion of the address.

        "explanation":  "When an IPv6 device needs to find the MAC address of a local device based on that device\u0026#39;s IPv6 address (like ARP with IPv4), it uses the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message. The device using that IPv6 address then returns (assuming it exists on the local network) a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message. So in this question, an NA and NS message would flow, but the NS message is the message sent by PC1 to request R1\u0026#39;s MAC address.\n\n\tFor the other two incorrect answers, host PC1 may need use a Router Solicitation (RS) message to request each router on the LAN to announce itself along with its IPv6 addresses and known IPv6 prefixes. Router R1 would then reply with an Router Advertisement (RA) message listing that information. However, the RA message lists IPv6 addressing and prefix information, but not MAC address information, which is what the question mentions.",

        "explanation":  "SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) uses NDP messages so that hosts learn the IPv6 prefixes on the link from any routers connected to the link. Hosts ask for this information using Router Solicitation (RS) messages, with routers replying with Router Advertisement (RA) messages \u0026ndash; both part of NDP. The RA messages can supply information such as:\n\n\n\tIPv6 prefixes on the link\n\tRouter IPv6 addresses on the link\n\tA list of DNS servers\n\n\nAdditionally, NDP replaces the functions done by ARP in IPv4. It uses Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages so any IPv6 host can request and learn the MAC address used by other online IPv6 endpoints.\n\nInformation about routes for prefixes not located on the same link requires other tools, like dynamic routing protocols used on routers. Hosts do not usually need a dynamic process to learn specific routes for IPv6 subnets located beyond the local link. Instead, hosts rely on their default router setting as learned from routers via the NDP RA messages",

        "explanation":  "The RDNSS acronym refers to RA-based DNS Server configuration. Knowing that fact alone should identify one correct and incorrect answer: The host learns the DNS server list from the NDP RA message. RDNSS replaces stateless DHCP for the same purpose, a tool that stores the list of DNS servers on a DHCP server and uses DHCP messages to inform the host.\n\nThe host learns the other settings using typical SLAAC processes. When using SLAAC, the host finds its address prefix from the NDP RA message that one or more routers on the subnet send. The RA identifies the prefixes that exist on the subnet. From that, the host self-assigns a unicast address using that prefix and then chooses an interface ID (IID). Most host operating systems use a randomized process to select the IID rather than using EUI-64.\n\nA SLAAC host learns its default router setting from the router itself. The router sends an NDP RA message which includes the router\u0026#39;s IPv6 address (an LLA) that hosts should use as their default router setting. The host does not need to use any information stored on the DHCP server.",

The host uses calendared addresses for TCP and UDP flows the host initiates. For connections initiated into the host, the host would typically use a permanent address rather than a temporary one (a fact confirming one answer as incorrect.)\n\nThe three address attributes related to the calendared temporary addresses, used for flows initiated by the host, include:\n\nPreferred: Use to initiate all new connections at this time, typically with a single preferred address on an interface at any instant.\n\nValid: Formerly-preferred addresses which can continue to send packets over existing flows. However, the host does not create new flows using a valid address.\n\nDeprecated: Formerly valid addresses that the host no longer uses. No packet flow occurs with addresses with this attribute.\n\nThe facts in the above list confirm the reasoning behind the two correct answers and rule out the remaining incorrect answers.",

Assume all links are up and working with the addresses shown in the figure. Which answer lists a command that configures a working route on router R1? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "IOS may reject an ipv6 route command when configured. It may accept the command, placing it into the configuration, but only add a route to the IPv6 routing table per that configuration under certain conditions. Sometimes, the route placed into the routing table may not be useful for forwarding IPv6 packets. Working through the commands in the various answers:\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 command: IOS accepts the command, adds it to the configuration, and adds a route to the routing table. However, the route does not function nor attempt to forward packets to R2 as the next-hop router.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 fe80::2 command: IOS rejects the command. IOS logic allows it to recognize the next-hop address as an LLA. IOS also requires an outgoing interface parameter on the command if referring to an LLA as the next-hop address.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The route should work because IOS should have a route that matches the next-hop address 2001:db8:1:12::2, as it is an address in the subnet between the two routers. \n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 fe80::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The command lists the correct outgoing interface (R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1) and the LLA that router R2 uses on the link between R1 and R2 (fe80::2), so the route should work to forward packets to router R2 next.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/0 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. However, the route refers to R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 as the outgoing interface, which is not the correct interface out which to forward packets for this route. As a result, this route will appear in the routing table but not be useful in forwarding packets.\n\nAs noted in the various explanations, two answers in this scenario result in a working route added to the routing table.",

The host device will then use this learned prefix and a calculated host-ID (EUI-64) to form a complete IPv6 address to use on a link. The host can also be configured to automatically use this advertising router IPv6 address as the next hop of a default route.",

Which answers list a command that would result in a static route appearing in R1\u0026#39;s IPv6 routing table, but R1 cannot use that route to forward packets successfully? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "IOS may reject an ipv6 route command when configured. It may accept the command, placing it into the configuration, but only add a route to the IPv6 routing table per that configuration under certain conditions. Sometimes, the route placed into the routing table may not be useful for forwarding IPv6 packets. Working through the commands in the various answers:\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 command: IOS accepts the command, adds it to the configuration, and adds a route to the routing table. However, the route does not function nor attempt to forward packets to R2 as the next-hop router.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 fe80::2 command: IOS rejects the configuration command. IOS logic allows it to recognize the next-hop address as an LLA. IOS also requires an outgoing interface parameter on the command if referring to an LLA as the next-hop address.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The route should work because IOS should have a route that matches the next-hop address 2001:db8:1:12::2, as it is an address in the subnet between the two routers. \n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 fe80::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The command lists the correct outgoing interface (R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1) and the LLA that router R2 uses on the link between R1 and R2 (fe80::2), so the route should work to forward packets to router R2 next.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/0 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. However, the route refers to R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 as the outgoing interface, which is not the correct interface out which to forward packets for this route. As a result, this route will appear in the routing table but not be useful in forwarding packets.\n\nAs noted in the various explanations, two answers in this scenario result in a non-working route added to the routing table.",
