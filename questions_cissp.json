So, thinking a bit deep, it is not a control. Therefore it is obviously a wrong choice\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eDBMS - yes, it is a system but can be used as a control for accounts, data management, data access, data encryption, and user access. \u0026nbsp;Why is this correct answer? We will discuss that below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIdentification and authentication of employees - this is a user control or audit. Neither technical nor logical. So, this is a wrong choice again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eSoftware testing - it is a process of approving software for final release or see how many bugs exist and testing is never really a complete process. Neither technical nor logical control. So, this is a wrong choice again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAntivirus management - This is a close second option as answer (to B) but it does not control with various choices for user or technical items. It sometimes has signatures and such but those are not actually a control for doing more than one function.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince F, G, H, I are combinations of A-E let us leave them and discuss the correct answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the above explanation there are two possible correct answers B and E. Remember thaty CISSP always poses this dilemma of choosing the best of these two close correct answers.

This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

        "explanation":  "A copyright ensures that a work that is authored is protected for any form of reproduction or use without the consent of the copyright holder, usually the author or artist who created the original work. A copyright lasts longer than a patent. Although the U.S. Copyright Office has several guidelines to determine the amount of time a copyright lasts, the general rule for works created after January 1, 1978, is the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn 1996, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) standardized the treatment of digital copyrights. Copyright management information (CMI) is licensing and ownership information that is added to any digital work. In this standardization, WIPO stipulated that CMI included in copyrighted material cannot be altered.",

Although malicious code can be inserted by a human threat agent, the code itself is a technical threat agent. Often you cannot identify the actual person who inserts malicious code. Threat agents are the entities responsible for exploiting a vulnerability. Threat agents can be grouped into the following six categories: Human: Includes both malicious and nonmalicious insiders and outsiders, terrorists, spies, and terminated personnel. Natural: Includes floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural disaster or weather event. Technical: Includes hardware and software failure, malicious code, and new technologies. Physical: Includes CCTV issues, perimeter measures failure, and biometric failure. Environmental: Includes power and other utility failure, traffic issues, biological warfare, and hazardous material issues (such as spillage). Operational: Includes any process or procedure that can affect CIA.",

An example of a vulnerability is unrestricted access to a folder on a computer. Most organizations implement a vulnerability assessment to identify vulnerabilities.\n\nA threat is the next logical progression in risk management. A threat occurs when a vulnerability is identified or exploited and is a potential danger. A threat would occur when an attacker identifies the folder on the computer that has an inappropriate or absent ACL.\n\nA threat is carried out by a threat agent. Continuing with the example, the attacker who takes advantage of the inappropriate or absent ACL is the threat agent. Keep in mind, though, that threat agents can discover and/or exploit vulnerabilities. Not all threat agents will actually exploit an identified vulnerability.\n\nAn exploit occurs when a threat agent successfully takes advantage of a vulnerability.",

        "explanation":  "Due diligence is the act of investigation and assessment. Organizations must institute the appropriate procedures to determine any risks to organizational assets. Due diligence then provides the information necessary to ensure that the organization practices due care. Without adequate due diligence, due care cannot occur.\n\nDue diligence is a process that includes but is not limited to employee background checks, business partner credit checks, system security assessments, risk assessments, penetration tests, and disaster recovery planning and testing. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, discussed earlier in this chapter, in the \u0026ldquo;Security Control Frameworks\u0026rdquo; section, provides guidance for implementing security controls that will help with due diligence.",

        "explanation":  "Policies - A security policy dictates the role of security as provided by senior management and is strategic in nature, meaning that it provides the end result of security. Policies are defined in two ways: the level in the organization at which they are enforced and the category to which they are applied. Policies must be general in nature, meaning they are independent of a specific technology or security solution. Policies outline goals but do not give any specific ways to accomplish the stated goals. All policies must contain an exception area to ensure that management will be able to deal with situations that might require exceptions.\n\nPolicies are broad and provide the foundation for development of processes, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures, all of which provide the security structure. Administrative, technical, and physical access controls fill in the security and structure needed to complete the security program. The policy levels used in information security are organizational security policies, system-specific security policies, and issue-specific security policies. The policy categories used in information security are regulatory security policies, advisory security policies, and informative security policies.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "Availability means ensuring that information, systems, and supporting infrastructure are operating and accessible when needed. The two main instances in which availability is affected are (1) when attacks are carried out that disable or cripple a system and (2) when service loss occurs during and after disasters. Each system should be assessed in terms of its criticality to organizational operations. Controls should be implemented based on each system\u0026rsquo;s criticality level.\n\nAvailability is the opposite of destruction or inoperability. Fault-tolerant technologies, such as RAID or alternate sites, are examples of controls that help improve availability.",

This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

        "explanation":  "Due care is a legal term that is used when an organization took all reasonable measures to prevent security breaches and also took steps to mitigate damages caused by successful breaches. Due diligence is a legal term that is used when an organization investigated all vulnerabilities. The default stance is the default security posture used by the organization. An allow-by-default stance permits access to any data unless a need exists to restrict access. A deny-by-default stance is much stricter because it denies any access that is not explicitly permitted. Qualitative risk analysis is method of analyzing risk whereby intuition, experience, and best practice techniques are used to determine risk.",

This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

        "explanation":  "The listed options are defines as follows: Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD): The maximum amount of time that an organization can tolerate a single resource or function being down. This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

        "explanation":  "Computer crimes today are usually made possible by a victim\u0026rsquo;s carelessness. If a computer crime has occurred, proving criminal intent and causation is often difficult. The ability to investigate and prosecute computer crimes is complicated by jurisdiction; many state-sponsored hackers reside in countries where the United States does not maintain a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT). An MLAT between two countries allows those countries to cooperate on law enforcement investigations, which may lead to the extradition of a criminal suspect.",

        "explanation":  "The listed options are defines as follows: Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD): The maximum amount of time that an organization can tolerate a single resource or function being down. This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

In some areas the water may freeze and burst the pipes causing damage. These are also not recommended for rooms where equipment will be damaged by the water. \n\nDry pipe extinguisher: In this system the water is not held in the pipes but in a holding tank. The pipes hold pressurized air, which is reduced when fire is detected allowing the water to enter the pipe and the sprinklers. This minimizes the chance of an accidental discharge. \n\nPreaction extinguisher: Operates like a dry pipe system except that the sprinkler head holds a thermal-fusible link that must melt before the water is released. This is currently the recommended system for a computer room. \n\nDeluge extinguisher: Allows large amounts of water to be released into the room, which obviously makes this not a good choice where computing equipment will be located.",

        "explanation":  "Tampering involves the changing of data to carry out an attack. Spoofing involves using someone else\u0026rsquo;s credentials to gain access to assets. Repudiation occurs when a user denies performing an action, and there is no way to prove that the user carried out an action. Information disclosure occurs when information is given to unauthorized users. Denial-of-service occurs when valid users are denied access to an asset they legitimately need. Escalation of privilege occurs when a user obtains a higher level of access to an asset than he should have.",

        "explanation":  "Non-repudiation is the assurance that a sender cannot deny an action, and often involves the sender being sent proof of delivery, while the receiver is provided with proof of the sender\u0026rsquo;s identify. This behavior is usually seen in electronic communications where one party denies sending a contract, document, or email. Non-repudiation means putting measures in place that will prevent the sender from denying that it sent a message.\n\nA valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and when encrypted with a signature, that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).",

Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) is an enterprise security architecture framework that uses the six communication questions (What, Where, When, Why, Who, and How) that intersect with six layers (operational, component, physical, logical, conceptual, and contextual).",

This team will have access to all local resources and will better determine the business continuity concerns of that location. You should not suggest that they develop a separate BCP scope for each department because the departments may be spread across several locations. You should not suggest that they develop a single BCP scope for the entire organization. This may cause the program to be unlimited in scope and make the plan much harder to implement.",

In some areas the water may freeze and burst the pipes causing damage. These are also not recommended for rooms where equipment will be damaged by the water. Dry pipe extinguisher: In this system the water is not held in the pipes but in a holding tank. The pipes hold pressurized air, which is reduced when fire is detected allowing the water to enter the pipe and the sprinklers. This minimizes the chance of an accidental discharge. Preaction extinguisher: Operates like a dry pipe system except that the sprinkler head holds a thermal-fusible link that must melt before the water is released. This is currently the recommended system for a computer room. Deluge extinguisher: Allows large amounts of water to be released into the room, which obviously makes this not a good choice where computing equipment will be located.",

        "explanation":  "The listed options are defines as follows: Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD): The maximum amount of time that an organization can tolerate a single resource or function being down. This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

Corrective controls are in place to reduce the effect of an attack or other undesirable event. Examples of corrective controls include installing fire extinguishers and implementing new firewall rules. Detective controls are in place to detect an attack while it is occurring to alert appropriate personnel. Examples of detective controls include motion detectors, IDSs, or guards. Compensative controls are in place to substitute for a primary access control and mainly act as a mitigation to risks. Examples of compensative controls include requiring two authorized signatures to release sensitive or confidential information and requiring two keys owned by different personnel to open a safety deposit box.",

        "explanation":  "Abstraction is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics. Abstraction usually results in named entities with a set of characteristics that help in their identification. However, unnecessary characteristics are hidden. Abstraction is related to both encapsulation and data hiding.",

This is also referred to as maximum period time of disruption (MPTD). Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time required to repair a single resource or function when a disaster or disruption occurs. Mean time between failure (MTBF): The estimated amount of time a device will operate before a failure occurs. This amount if calculated by the device vendor. System reliability is increased by a higher MTBF and lower MTTR. Recovery time objective (RTO): The shortest time period after a disaster or disruptive event within which a resource or function must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences. RTO assumes that there is an acceptable period of downtime. RTO should be smaller than MTD. Work recovery time (WRT): The difference between RTO and MTD, which is the remaining time that is left over after the RTO before reaching the maximum tolerable. Recovery point objective (RPO): The point in time to which the disrupted resource or function must be returned.",

        "explanation":  "Administrative investigations are investigations that do not result in any criminal, civil, or regulatory issue. Administrative investigations can also be referred to as operations investigations. In most cases, this type of investigation is completed to determine the root cause of an incident so that steps can be taken to prevent this incident from occurring again in the future. This process is referred to as root-cause analysis (RCA). Because no criminal, civil, or regulatory law has been violated, it is not as important to document the evidence. However, security professionals should still take measures to document the lessons learned.",

Always carefully consider any performance impact that may occur as a result of the auditing mechanism. Although auditing is necessary, it is important not to audit so many events that the auditing logs are littered with useless or unused information.",

Unauthorized access includes unauthorized digital and physical access. Data security also protects data against any threats that can affect data confidentiality, integrity, or availability.\nTo provide data security, an organization should implement security using a defense-in-depth strategy, as discussed in Chapter 1. If a single layer of access is not analyzed, then data is at risk. For example, you can implement authentication mechanisms to ensure that users must authenticate before digitally accessing the network. But if you do not have the appropriate physical security controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to your facility, an attacker can easily gain access to your network just by connecting an unauthorized device to the network.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "Which security technique controls what a user or group of users can see when they access the database?",
        "explanation":  "The listed techniques are defined as follows: Database Views: Refers to the given set of data that a user or group of users can see when they access the database. Database locks: Used when one user is accessing a record that prevents another user from accessing the record at the same time to prevent edits until the first user is finished. Polyinstantiation: A process used to prevent data inference violations. It does this by enabling a relation to contain multiple tuples with the same primary keys with each instance distinguished by a security level. It prevents low-level database users from inferring the existence of higher level data. OLTP ACID Test: An Online Transaction Processing system is used to monitor for problems such as processes that stop functioning. Its main goal is to prevent transactions that don\u0026rsquo;t happen properly or are not complete from taking effect. An ACID test ensures that each transaction has certain properties before it is committed.",

In end-to-end encryption, packet routing information and packet headers and addresses are not encrypted. As a result, potential hackers can obtain more information if a packet is acquired through packet sniffing or eavesdropping.\nEnd-to-end encryption has several advantages. A user usually initiates end-to-end encryption, which allows the user to select exactly what gets encrypted and how. It affects the performance of each device along the route less than link encryption because every device does not have to perform encryption/decryption to determine how to route the packet.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "What are the three states of data in general?",
        "explanation":  "Three basic data states must be considered as part of asset security. These three states are data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. Security professionals must ensure that controls are implemented to protect data in all three of these states.\nData at Rest\nData at rest is data that is being stored and not being actively used at a certain point in time. While data is at rest, security professionals must ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data are ensured. Confidentiality can be provided by implementing data encryption. Integrity can be provided by implementing the appropriate authentication mechanisms and ACLs so that only authenticated, authorized users can edit data. Availability can be provided by implementing a fault-tolerant storage solution, such as RAID.\nData in Transit\nData in transit is data that is being transmitted over a network or sent via a physical medium, like a DVD or flash drive. While data is being transmitted, security professionals must ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data are ensured. Confidentiality can be provided by implementing link encryption or end-to-end encryption. As with data at rest, authentication and ACLs can help with data integrity of data in transit. Availability can be provided by implementing server farms and dual backbones.\nData in Use\nData in use is data that is being accessed or manipulated in some way. Data manipulation includes editing the data and compiling the data into reports. The main issues with data in use are to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to or can read the data and that only authorized changes are allowed to the data. Confidentiality can be provided by using privacy or screen filters to prevent unauthorized individuals from reading data on a screen. It can also be provided by implementing a document shredding policy for all reports that contain PII, PHI, proprietary data, or other confidential information. Data integrity can be provided by implementing the appropriate controls on the data. Data locks can prevent data from being changed, and data rules can ensure that changes occur only within defined parameters. For certain data types, organizations may decide to implement two-person controls to ensure that data changes are entered and verified. Availability can be provided by using the same strategies as used for data at rest and data in transit.\n\u0026nbsp;",

The warehouse is used to carry out analysis. The data is not simply combined but is processed and presented in a more useful and understandable way. Data warehouses require stringent security because the data is not dispersed but located in a central location. Within data warehouses, organizations may also designate a data mart, which is a subset of data from the data warehouse that is used for analytics and business intelligence users.",

        "explanation":  "Data Custodian\nData custodians must understand the levels of data access that can be given to users. Data custodians work with data owners to determine the level of access that should be given. This is an excellent example of separations. By having separate roles such as data owners and data custodians, an organization can ensure that no single role is responsible for data access. This setup prevents fraudulent creation of user accounts and assignment of rights.\nData custodians should understand data policies and guidelines. They should document the data structures in the organization and the levels of access given. They are also responsible for data storage, archiving, and backups. Finally, they should be concerned with data quality and should therefore implement the appropriate audit controls.\nCentralized data custodians are common. Data owners give the data custodians the permission level that users and groups should be given. Data custodians actually implement the access control lists (ACLs) for the devices, databases, folders, and files.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "Which security technique prevents two users from accessing a record at the same time to prevent conflicting edits?",
        "explanation":  "The listed techniques are defined as follows: Database Views: Refers to the given set of data that a user or group of users can see when they access the database. Database locks: Used when one user is accessing a record that prevents another user from accessing the record at the same time to prevent edits until the first user is finished. Polyinstantiation: A process used to prevent data inference violations. It does this by enabling a relation to contain multiple tuples with the same primary keys with each instance distinguished by a security level. It prevents low-level database users from inferring the existence of higher level data. OLTP ACID Test: An Online Transaction Processing system is used to monitor for problems such as processes that stop functioning. Its main goal is to prevent transactions that don\u0026rsquo;t happen properly or are not complete from taking effect. An ACID test ensures that each transaction has certain properties before it is committed.",

        "explanation":  "As part of asset retention, security professionals need to understand two terms: end of life (EOL) and end of support (EOS). These terms apply to any software or hardware asset. EOL is the date when a vendor stops offering a product for sale. However, the product is still supported (such as warranties, updates, and repairs) by the vendor, at least for a while. This support usually includes deploying security updates for the product. EOS, also referred to as end-of-service life (EOSL), is the date when all vendor support ends. Organizations sometimes retain legacy hardware to access older data, such as data on tape drives. Legacy applications can also be retained if the application provides a particular function and a replacement application has not been selected. If legacy hardware or applications need to be retained, security professionals should take measures to ensure that they are deployed in a manner that prevents remote access, including deploying them on an isolated network.",

        "explanation":  "Sensitivity is a measure of how freely data can be handled. Some data requires special care and handling, especially when inappropriate handling could result in penalties, identity theft, financial loss, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized access by an individual or many individuals. Some data is also subject to regulation by state or federal laws and requires notification in the event of a disclosure.\nData is assigned a level of sensitivity based on who should have access to it and how much harm would be done if it were disclosed. This assignment of sensitivity is called data classification.\nCriticality is a measure of the importance of the data. Data that is considered sensitive may not necessarily be considered critical. Assigning a level of criticality to a particular data set requires considering the answers to a few questions:\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Will you be able to recover the data in case of disaster?\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;How long will it take to recover the data?\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;What is the effect of this downtime, including loss of public standing?\n\u0026nbsp;",

When essential data is not available, even for a brief period of time, or when its integrity is questionable, the organization is unable to function. Data is considered required when it is important to the organization but organizational operations would continue for a predetermined period of time even if the data were not available. Data is nonessential if the organization is able to operate without it during extended periods of time.",

        "explanation":  "The listed rating levels have the following characteristics: A1: Implies that the security assurance, design, development, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of a computer is performed in a formal and detailed manner. B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects. D: Minimal protection rating that is offered to systems that fail to meet the evaluation criteria.",

        "explanation":  "DES and 3DES\n\nDigital Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric encryption system created by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) but based on the 128-bit Lucifer algorithm by IBM. Originally, the algorithm was named Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA), and the DES acronym was used to refer to the standard. But in today\u0026rsquo;s world, DES is the more common term for both.\n\nDES uses a 64-bit key, 8 bits of which are used for parity. Therefore, the effective key length for DES is 56 bits. DES divides the message into 64-bit blocks. Sixteen rounds of transposition and substitution are performed on each block, resulting in a 64-bit block of ciphertext\n\nDES Modes\n\nDES comes in the following five modes:\n\n\n\tElectronic Code Book (ECB)\n\tCipher Block Chaining (CBC)\n\tCipher Feedback (CFB)\n\tOutput Feedback (OFB)\n\tCounter Mode (CTR)",

When NIST decided a new standard was needed because DES had been cracked, NIST was presented with five industry options:\n\n\n\tIBM\u0026rsquo;s MARS\n\tRSA Laboratories\u0026rsquo; RC6\n\tAnderson, Biham, and Knudsen\u0026rsquo;s Serpent\n\tCounterpane Systems\u0026rsquo; Twofish\n\tDaemen and Rijmen\u0026rsquo;s Rijndael\n\n\nOf these choices, NIST selected Rijndael. So although AES is considered the standard, the algorithm that is used in the AES standard is the Rijndael algorithm. The AES and Rijndael terms are often used interchangeably.",

        "explanation":  "The listed terms are defined as follows: Cipher lock: Uses a key pad that requires the correct code to open the lock. Proximity authentication device: A programmable card used to deliver an access code to the device either by swiping the card or in some cases just being in the vicinity of the reader. Mantrap: A series of two doors with a small room between them. Warded locks: Lock with a spring-loaded bolt with a notch in it. The lock has wards or metal projection inside the lock with which the key matches and enables opening the lock. Tumbler locks: Lock with more moving parts than the warded lock with the key raising the lock metal piece to the correct height. Combination lock: Lock requires rotating the lock in a pattern, which if correct lines the tumblers up opening the lock. cable lock: Vinyl-coated steel cables that connect to the laptop and then lock around an object.",

Implied addressing: Refers to registers usually contained inside the CPU. Absolute addressing: Addresses the entire primary memory space. The CPU uses the physical memory addresses that are called absolute addresses. Cache: A relatively small amount (when compared to primary memory) of high-speed RAM, which holds the instructions and data from primary memory that has a high probability of being accessed during the currently executing portion of a program. Indirect addressing: The type of memory addressing where the address location that is specified in the program instruction contains the address of the final desired location. Logical address: The address at which a memory cell or storage element appears to reside from the perspective of an executing application program. Relative address: Specifies its location by indicating its distance from another address. Virtual memory: A location on the hard drive used temporarily for storage when memory space is low. Memory leak: Occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations, which can exhaust available system memory as an application runs.",

Proximity authentication device: A programmable card used to deliver an access code to the device either by swiping the card or in some cases just being in the vicinity of the reader. Mantrap: A series of two doors with a small room between them. Warded locks: Lock with a spring-loaded bolt with a notch in it. The lock has wards or metal projection inside the lock with which the key matches and enables opening the lock. Tumbler locks: Lock with more moving parts than the warded lock with the key raising the lock metal piece to the correct height. Combination lock: Lock requires rotating the lock in a pattern, which if correct lines the tumblers up opening the lock.

A replay attack is one in which an attacker monitors the traffic stream in a network and maliciously repeats or delays the transmission of valid data over the network.",

        "explanation":  "Sally need John\u0026rsquo;s private key to read the email but private keys are never disclosed to anyone. Asymmetric algorithms use both a public key and a private or secret key. The public key is known by all parties, and the private key is known only by its owner. One of these keys encrypts the message, and the other decrypts the message.\n\nIn asymmetric cryptography, determining a user\u0026rsquo;s private key is virtually impossible even if the public key is known, although both keys are mathematically related. However, if a user\u0026rsquo;s private key is discovered, the encryption system can be compromised.\n\nAsymmetric algorithms can be referred to as dual-key or public key cryptography.",

        "explanation":  "Security Modes\n\nA mandatory access control (MAC) system operates in different security modes at various times, based on variables such as sensitivity of data, the clearance level of the user, and the actions users are authorized to take. The following sections provide descriptions of these modes.\n\nDedicated Security Mode\n\nA system is operating in dedicated security mode if it employs a single classification level. In this system, all users can access all data, but they must sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) and be formally approved for access on a need-to-know basis.\n\nSystem High Security Mode\n\nIn a system operating in system high security mode, all users have the same security clearance (as in the dedicated security model), but they do not all possess a need- to-know clearance for all the information in the system. Consequently, although users might have clearance to access an object, they still might be restricted if they do not have need-to-know clearance pertaining to the object.\n\nCompartmented Security Mode\n\nIn the compartmented security mode system, all users must possess the highest security clearance (as in both dedicated and system high security), but they must also have valid need-to-know clearance, a signed NDA, and formal approval for all information to which they have access. The objective is to ensure that the minimum number of people possible have access to information at each level or compartment.\n\nMultilevel Security Mode\n\nWhen a system allows two or more classification levels of information to be processed at the same time, it is said to be operating in multilevel security mode. Users must have a signed NDA for all the information in the system and will have access to subsets based on their clearance level, need-to-know, and formal access approval. These systems involve the highest risk because information is processed at more than one level of security, even when all system users do not have appropriate clearances or a need to know for all information processed by the system. This is also sometimes called controlled security mode.",

        "explanation":  "When more than one processor is present and available, the system becomes capable of multiprocessing. This capability allows the computer to execute multiple instructions in parallel. It can be done with separate physical processors or with a single processor with multiple cores. When multiple cores are used, each core operates as a separate CPU.\n\nCPUs have their own memory, and the CPU is able to access this memory faster than any other memory location. It also typically has cache memory where the most recently executed instructions are kept in case they are needed again. When a CPU gets an instruction from memory, the process is called fetching.\n\nAn arithmetic logic unit (ALU) in the CPU performs the actual execution of the instructions. The control unit acts as the system manager while instructions from applications and operating systems are executed. CPU registers contain the instruction set information and data to be executed and include general registers, special registers, and a program counter register.\n\u0026nbsp;",

The three valid concepts are Natural Access Control: This concept applies to the entrances of the facility. It encompasses the placement of the doors, lights, fences, and even landscaping. It aims to satisfy security goals in the least obtrusive and aesthetically appealing manner. Natural surveillance is the use of physical environmental features to promote visibility of all areas and thus discourage crime in those areas. The idea is to encourage the flow of people such that the largest possible percentage of the building is always populated because people in an area discourage crime. Natural Territorials Reinforcement: The goal is to create a feeling of community in the area. It attempts to extend the sense of ownership to the employees.\nChapter 3\u0026nbsp; Security Architecture and Engineering , CPTED",

        "explanation":  "AES is the replacement algorithm for DES. When NIST decided a new standard was needed because DES had been cracked, NIST was presented with five industry options:\n\n\n\tIBM\u0026rsquo;s MARS\n\tRSA Laboratories\u0026rsquo; RC6\n\tAnderson, Biham, and Knudsen\u0026rsquo;s Serpent\n\tCounterpane Systems\u0026rsquo; Twofish\n\tDaemen and Rijmen\u0026rsquo;s Rijndael\n\n\nOf these choices, NIST selected Rijndael. So although AES is considered the standard, the algorithm that is used in the AES standard is the Rijndael algorithm. The AES and Rijndael terms are often used interchangeably.\n\nThe three block sizes that are used in the Rijndael algorithm are 128, 192, and 256 bits. A 128-bit key with a 128-bit block size undergoes 10 transformation rounds. A 192-bit key with a 192-bit block size undergoes 12 transformation rounds. Finally, a 256-bit key with a 256-bit block size undergoes 14 transformation rounds",

        "explanation":  "Diffie-Hellman is an asymmetric key agreement algorithm created by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Diffie-Hellman is responsible for the key agreement process. The key agreement process includes the following steps:\n\n\n\tJohn and Sally need to communicate over an encrypted channel and decide to use Diffie-Hellman.\n\tJohn generates a private and public key, and Sally generates a private and a public key.\n\tJohn and Sally share their public keys with each other.\n\tAn application on John\u0026rsquo;s computer takes John\u0026rsquo;s private key and Sally\u0026rsquo;s public key and applies the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, and an application on Sally\u0026rsquo;s computer takes Sally\u0026rsquo;s private key and John\u0026rsquo;s public key and applies the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.\n\tThrough this application, the same shared value is created for John and Sally, which in turn creates the same symmetric key on each system using the asymmetric key agreement algorithm.\n\n\nThrough this process, Diffie-Hellman provides secure key distribution, but not confidentiality, authentication, or non-repudiation. The key to this algorithm is dealing with discrete logarithms. Diffie-Hellman is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (or on-path) attacks unless an organization implements digital signatures or digital certificates for authentication at the beginning of the Diffie-Hellman process.",

B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects. D: Minimal protection rating that is offered to systems that fail to meet the evaluation criteria.",

Lipner model: Shares characteristics with the Clark- Wilson model in that it separates objects into data and programs. Brewer-Nash (Chinese Wall) model: Model that introduced the concept of allowing access controls to change dynamically based on a user\u0026rsquo;s previous actions.",

        "explanation":  "The listed memory and memory management terms are defined as follows: Associative memory: Searches for a specific data value in memory rather than using a specific memory address. Implied addressing: Refers to registers usually contained inside the CPU. Absolute addressing: Addresses the entire primary memory space. The CPU uses the physical memory addresses that are called absolute addresses. Cache: A relatively small amount (when compared to primary memory) high speed RAM, which holds the instructions and data from primary memory, which has a high probability of being accessed during the currently executing portion of a program. Indirect addressing: The type of memory addressing where the address location that is specified in the program instruction contains the address of the final desired location. Logical address: The address at which a memory cell or storage element appears to reside from the perspective of an executing application program. Relative address: Specifies its location by indicating its distance from another address. Virtual memory: A location on the hard drive used temporarily for storage when memory space is low. Memory leak: Occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations which can exhaust available system memory as an application runs.",

        "explanation":  "Diffie-Hellman is an asymmetric key agreement algorithm created by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Diffie-Hellman is responsible for the key agreement process. The key agreement process includes the following steps:\n\n1. Michael and Laura\u0026nbsp;need to communicate over an encrypted channel and decide to use Diffie-Hellman.\n2. Michael generates a private and public key, and Laura generates a private and a public key.\n3. Michael and Laura\u0026nbsp;share their public keys with each other.\n4. An application on Michael\u0026#39;s computer takes his private key and Laura\u0026rsquo;s public key and applies the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, and an application on Laura\u0026rsquo;s computer takes her private key and Michael\u0026rsquo;s public key and applies the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.\n5. Through this application, the same shared value is created for Michael and Laura, which in turn creates the same symmetric key on each system using the asymmetric key agreement algorithm.",

A comparison of the sender\u0026rsquo;s hash value to the receiver\u0026rsquo;s hash value determines message integrity. If the resultant hash values are different, then the message has been altered in some way, provided that both the sender and receiver used the same hash function.",

In some areas the water may freeze and burst the pipes causing damage. These are also not recommended for rooms where equipment will be damaged by the water. Dry pipe extinguisher: In this system the water is not held in the pipes but in a holding tank. The pipes hold pressurized air, which is reduced when fire is detected allowing the water to enter the pipe and the sprinklers. This minimizes the chance of an accidental discharge. Preaction extinguisher: Operates like a dry pipe system except that the sprinkler head holds a thermal-fusible link that must be melted before the water is released. This is currently the recommended system for a computer room. Deluge extinguisher: Allows large amounts of water to be released into the room, which obviously does not make a good choice where computing equipment will be located.",

        "explanation":  "The listed rating levels have the following characteristics: A1: Implies that the security assurance, design, development, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of a computer is performed in a formal and detailed manner. B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects.",

In some areas the water may freeze and burst the pipes causing damage. These are also not recommended for rooms where equipment will be damaged by the water. Dry pipe extinguisher: In this system the water is not held in the pipes but in a holding tank. The pipes hold pressurized air, which is reduced when fire is detected allowing the water to enter the pipe and the sprinklers. This minimizes the chance of an accidental discharge. Preaction extinguisher: Operates like a dry pipe system except that the sprinkler head holds a thermal-fusible link that must melt before the water is released. This is currently the recommended system for a computer room. Deluge extinguisher: Allows large amounts of water to be released into the room, which obviously does not make this a good choice where computing equipment will be located.",

Most products provide free egress or exit whether they are fail safe or fail secure.\n\nFail-safe products should never be used for areas of high security.

        "explanation":  "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) refers to designing the facility from the ground up to support security. The three valid concepts are Natural Access Control: This concept applies to the entrances of the facility. It encompasses the placement of the doors, lights, fences, and even landscaping. It aims to satisfy security goals in the least obtrusive and aesthetically appealing manner. Natural surveillance is the use of physical environmental features to promote visibility of all areas and thus discourage crime in those areas. The idea is to encourage the flow of people such that the largest possible percentage of the building is always populated because people in an area discourage crime. Natural Territorials Reinforcement: The goal is to create a feeling of community in the area. It attempts to extend the sense of ownership to the employees.",

Multilevel Lattice Model: Developed mainly to deal with confidentiality issues and focuses mainly on information flow. Matrix-based model: Organizes tables of subjects and objects indicating what actions individual subjects can take upon individual objects. Noninterference model: Model less concerned with the flow of information and more concerned with a subject\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of the state of the system at a point in time; it concentrates on preventing the actions that take place at one level from altering the state presented to another level. Information Flow model: Model that focuses on controlling information flows that relate two versions of the same object.",

CAs operating under NISTIR 7924 will make public a description of how to obtain revocation information for the certificates they publish, and an explanation of the consequences of using dated revocation information. This information will be given to subscribers during certificate request or issuance, and will be readily available to any potential relying party. Revocation requests must be authenticated.\n\nA certificate will be revoked when the binding between the subject and the subject\u0026rsquo;s public key defined within the certificate is no longer considered valid. When this situation occurs, the associated certificate will be revoked and placed on the CRL and/or added to the OCSP responder. (Both CRL and OCSP are explained in the following sections.) Revoked certificates will be included on all new publications of the certificate status information until the certificates expire.\n\nCAs should revoke certificates as quickly as practical upon receipt of a proper revocation request and by the requested revocation time.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "The Lipner model is an implementation that combines elements of the Bell-LaPadula model and the Biba model. The first way of implementing integrity with the Lipner model uses Bell-LaPadula and assigns subjects to one of two sensitivity levels system manager and anyone else and to one of four job categories. Objects are assigned specific levels and categories. Categories become the most significant integrity (such as access control) mechanism. The second implementation uses both Bell-LaPadula and Biba. This method prevents unauthorized users from modifying data and prevents authorized users from making improper data modifications. The implementations also share characteristics with the Clark-Wilson model in that it separates objects into data and programs.",

It is most often associated with an organization\u0026rsquo;s financial accounting policies whereby controls are put into place for issuing checks. The person inputting the payment information is usually a separate person than the one who signs or otherwise authorizes the checks after printing. In addition, organizations often implement policies whereby checks above a certain amount require two signatures.\n\nSoD, as it relates to security, has two primary objectives: (1) to prevent conflict of interest, fraud, abuse, or errors and (2) to detect control failures, including breaches, data theft, and circumvention of security controls.",

        "explanation":  "Security Modes\n\nA mandatory access control (MAC) system operates in different security modes at various times, based on variables such as sensitivity of data, the clearance level of the user, and the actions users are authorized to take. The following sections provide descriptions of these modes.\n\nDedicated Security Mode\n\nA system is operating in dedicated security mode if it employs a single classification level. In this system, all users can access all data, but they must sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) and be formally approved for access on a need-to-know basis.\n\nSystem High Security Mode\n\nIn a system operating in system high security mode, all users have the same security clearance (as in the dedicated security model), but they do not all possess a need- to-know clearance for all the information in the system. Consequently, although users might have clearance to access an object, they still might be restricted if they do not have need-to-know clearance pertaining to the object.\n\nCompartmented Security Mode\n\nIn the compartmented security mode system, all users must possess the highest security clearance (as in both dedicated and system high security), but they must also have valid need-to-know clearance, a signed NDA, and formal approval for all information to which they have access. The objective is to ensure that the minimum number of people possible have access to information at each level or compartment.\n\nMultilevel Security Mode\n\nWhen a system allows two or more classification levels of information to be processed at the same time, it is said to be operating in multilevel security mode. Users must have a signed NDA for all the information in the system and will have access to subsets based on their clearance level, need-to-know, and formal access approval. These systems involve the highest risk because information is processed at more than one level of security, even when all system users do not have appropriate clearances or a need to know for all information processed by the system. This is also sometimes called controlled security mode.",

        "explanation":  "Transform domain techniques are when secret information is embedded in the frequency domain of the signal. Least significant bit steganography is when some or all of the bits or bytes inside an image are replaced with bits of the secret message. Statistical methods encode information by changing several statistical properties of a cover. Distortion techniques are when the knowledge of the original cover in the decoding process is essential at the receiver side.",

        "explanation":  "A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of digital certificates that a CA has irreversibly revoked. To find out whether a digital certificate has been revoked, the browser must either check the CRL or receive the CRL values pushed out from the CA. This process can become quite daunting when you consider that the CRL contains every certificate that has ever been revoked.\n\nOne concept to keep in mind is the revocation request grace period. This period is the maximum amount of time between when the revocation request is received by the CA and when the revocation actually occurs. A shorter revocation period provides better security but often results in a higher implementation cost.",

        "explanation":  "A brute-force attack executed against a cryptographic algorithm uses all possible keys until a key is discovered that successfully decrypts the ciphertext. A frequency analysis attack relies on the fact that substitution and transposition ciphers will result in repeated patterns in ciphertext. A reverse engineering attack occurs when an attacker purchases a particular cryptographic product to attempt to reverse engineer the product to discover confidential information about the cryptographic algorithm used. A ciphertext-only attack uses several encrypted messages (ciphertext) to figure out the key used in the encryption process.",

        "explanation":  "The listed rating levels have the following characteristics: A1: Implies that the security assurance, design, development, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of a computer is performed in a formal and detailed manner. B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects. D: Minimal protection rating that is offered to systems that fail to meet the evaluation criteria.",

B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects. D: Minimal protection rating that is offered to systems that fail to meet the evaluation criteria.",

Flame actuated sensor: Optical devices that \u0026quot;look at\u0026quot; the protected area. They generally react faster to a fire than nonoptical devices do. Wet pipe extinguisher: Uses water contained in pipes to extinguish the fire. In some areas the water may freeze and burst the pipes causing damage. These are also not recommended for rooms where equipment will be damaged by the water.",

A PKI publishes digital certificates. Because a PKI establishes trust within an environment, a PKI can certify that a public key is tied to an entity and verify that a public key is valid. Public keys are published through digital certificates.\n\nThe X.509 standard is a framework that enables authentication between networks and over the Internet. A PKI includes timestamping and certificate revocation to ensure that certificates are managed properly. A PKI provides confidentiality, message integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.\n\nThe structure of a PKI includes certification authorities, certificates, registration authorities, certificate revocation lists, cross-certification, and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).",

        "explanation":  "The Bell-LaPadula security model does have limitations. Among those are\n\nIt contains no provision or policy for changing data access control. Therefore, it works well only with access systems that are static in nature.\n\nIt does not address what are called covert channels. A low-level subject can sometimes detect the existence of a high-level object when it is denied access. Sometimes it is not enough to hide the content of an object; also their existence might have to be hidden.\n\nIts main contribution at the expense of other concepts is confidentiality.",

        "explanation":  "The listed model types are defined as follows: State Machine model: By examining every possible state the system could be in and ensuring that the system maintains the proper security relationship between objects and subjects in each state, the system is said to be secure. Multilevel Lattice models: Developed mainly to deal with confidentiality issues and focuses mainly on information flow. Matrix-based model: Organizes tables of subjects and objects indicating what actions individual subjects can take upon individual objects. Noninterference model: Model less concerned with the flow of information and more concerned with a subject\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of the state of the system at a point in time; it concentrates on preventing the actions that take place at one level from altering the state presented to another level. Information Flow model: Model that focuses on controlling information flows that relate two versions of the same object.",

        "explanation":  "The listed memory and memory management terms are defined as follows: Associative memory: Searches for a specific data value in memory rather than using a specific memory address. Implied addressing: Refers to registers usually contained inside the CPU. Absolute addressing: Addresses the entire primary memory space. The CPU uses the physical memory addresses that are called absolute addresses. Cache: A relatively small amount (when compared to primary memory) of high-speed RAM, which holds the instructions and data from primary memory that has a high probability of being accessed during the currently executing portion of a program. Indirect addressing: The type of memory addressing where the address location that is specified in the program instruction contains the address of the final desired location. Logical address: The address at which a memory cell or storage element appears to reside from the perspective of an executing application program. Relative address: Specifies its location by indicating its distance from another address. Virtual memory: A location on the hard drive used temporarily for storage when memory space is low. Memory leak: Occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations, which can exhaust available system memory as an application runs.",

        "explanation":  "DES and 3DES\n\nDigital Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric encryption system created by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) but based on the 128-bit Lucifer algorithm by IBM. Originally, the algorithm was named Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA), and the DES acronym was used to refer to the standard. But in today\u0026rsquo;s world, DES is the more common term for both.\n\nDES uses a 64-bit key, 8 bits of which are used for parity. Therefore, the effective key length for DES is 56 bits. DES divides the message into 64-bit blocks. Sixteen rounds of transposition and substitution are performed on each block, resulting in a 64-bit block of ciphertext\n\nDES Modes\n\nDES comes in the following five modes:\n\n\n\tElectronic Code Book (ECB)\n\tCipher Block Chaining (CBC)\n\tCipher Feedback (CFB)\n\tOutput Feedback (OFB)\n\tCounter Mode (CTR)",

B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects. D: Minimal protection rating that is offered to systems that fail to meet the evaluation criteria.",

        "explanation":  "One-way hashing is commonly used to ensure data integrity. By generating a unique hash value for each file using a cryptographic hash function, any changes to the file, no matter how small, will result in a significantly different hash value. Therefore, comparing the hash value of a file against a previously generated hash value allows for quick and efficient verification of file integrity. If the hash values match, it indicates that the file has not been altered since the hash was generated, thus verifying its accuracy.",

        "explanation":  "The listed memory and memory management terms are defined as follows: Associative memory: Searches for a specific data value in memory rather than using a specific memory address. Implied addressing: Refers to registers usually contained inside the CPU. Absolute addressing: Addresses the entire primary memory space. The CPU uses the physical memory addresses that are called absolute addresses. Cache: A relatively small amount (when compared to primary memory) of high-speed RAM, which holds the instructions and data from primary memory that has a high probability of being accessed during the currently executing portion of a program. Indirect addressing: The type of memory addressing where the address location that is specified in the program instruction contains the address of the final desired location. Logical address: The address at which a memory cell or storage element appears to reside from the perspective of an executing application program. Relative address: Specifies its location by indicating its distance from another address. Virtual memory: A location on the hard drive used temporarily for storage when memory space is low. Memory leak: Occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations, which can exhaust available system memory as an application runs.",

        "explanation":  "The listed rating levels have the following characteristics: A1: Implies that the security assurance, design, development, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of a computer is performed in a formal and detailed manner. B1: Offers process isolation, the use of device labels, the use of design specification and verification, and mandatory access controls. B1 systems are used to handle classified information. B2: Refers to structured protection. This level is the lowest level to implement trusted facility management; levels B3 and A1 also implement it. Therefore, a B2 system should be resistant to penetration attempts. B3:- Refers to security domains. B3 systems should perform a trusted recovery. A B3 system should provide the monitoring and auditing functionality. A B3 system is used in environments that contain highly sensitive information and should be resistant to penetration attempts. Another feature of B3 rating is covert timing channel analysis. C1: Refers to discretionary security protection. To enable the rating process, subjects and objects should be separated from the auditing facility by using a clear identification and authentication process. C2: Refers to controlled access protection. A C2 system provides granular access control and establishes a level of accountability when subjects access objects. D: Minimal protection rating that is offered to systems that fail to meet the evaluation criteria.",

In this case, personnel can leave the area, but they must use a key to enter the area. These terms refer to the status of the secure side of the door. Most products provide free egress or exit whether they are fail safe or fail secure.\n\nFail-safe products should never be used for areas of high security. Simply cutting the power would give a threat actor access to the security area. Security professionals should ensure that public or general areas use fail-safe products, whereas secure areas, such as data centers, use fail-secure products.",

        "questionText":  "Which of the following are the BEST performance metrics of a network?",
        "explanation":  "Several performance metrics are used to measure network reliability, quality of service and speed. One such metric is bandwidth, which measures the capacity of a wired or wireless network. More specifically, bandwidth refers to the number of bits, kilobits, megabits, or gigabits that can be sent within a set time \u0026ndash; usually per second. The greater the bandwidth the more data that can be sent per second. Latency refers to the time it takes for data to be transmitted from one end point to another endpoint, on a network, and is measured in milliseconds. Consequently, latency impacts the user experience; higher latency means that it takes the user longer to see a response to a request on a network. In an age where we rely more on the Cloud for storage, data is often physically further away from a client computer. Therefore, a response to a data request can take more time to be completed, which means greater latency. Jitter refers to disruption or uneven intervals between data packets being transmitted \u0026ndash; sometimes referred to as packet delay variation (PDV). Jitter can occur with real-time applications, such as video streaming and VoIP calls, where speed of delivery is prioritized over the negative effects of jitter. There are several services that perform Internet service speed tests that indicate jitter in milliseconds. Throughput measures how much data was actually transmitted from a source to a destination, within a specified timeframe. This is different from bandwidth, which is a theoretical measurement, i.e. how much data could potentially be transferred? Throughput is often measured in bits per second. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a comparison between the power of a signal (or amplitude) and unwanted noise. This measurement is often denoted in decibels (dB) and the higher the SNR the better. Noise refers to background noise, such as people talking in the background.",

To monitor traffic on the network segment, the NIC must be operating in promiscuous mode. A NIDS can monitor only the network traffic. It cannot monitor any internal activity that occurs within a system, such as an attack against a system that is carried out by logging on to the system\u0026rsquo;s local terminal. An NIDS is affected by a switched network because generally an NIDS monitors only a single network segment.\u0026nbsp; A host-based IDS (HIDS) monitors traffic on a single system. Its primary responsibility is to protect the system on which it is installed. An HIDS uses information from the operating system audit trails and system logs. The detection capabilities of an HIDS are limited by how complete the audit logs and system logs are.",

        "explanation":  "Spear Phishing\n\nPhishing is a social engineering attack where a recipient is convinced to click a link in an email that appears to go to a trusted site but in fact goes to the hacker\u0026rsquo;s site. This attack is used to harvest usernames and passwords.\n\nSpear phishing is the process of foisting this attack on a specific person, such as a company manager or human resources manager rather than a random set of people. The attack might be made more convincing by learning details about the person through social media that the email might reference to boost its appearance of legitimacy.\n\nWhaling\n\nJust as spear phishing is a subset of phishing, whaling is a subset of spear phishing. It targets a single person, and in the case of whaling, that person is someone of significance or importance. It might be a CEO, CFO, CSO, COO, or CTO, for example. The attack is based on the assumption that these people have more sensitive information to divulge.",

This process is called time-division multiplexing (TDM). Multiplexing is the process of using the same medium for multiple transmissions. The transmissions take turns rather than send at the same time.\n\nBroadband, on the other hand, divides the medium into different frequencies, a process called frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). This process has the benefit of allowing true simultaneous use of the medium.",

It simply adds information to the developing packet. In the case of the Presentation layer, information is added that standardizes the formatting of the information if required.\nLayer 6 is responsible for the manner in which the data from the Application layer is represented (or presented) to the Application layer on the destination device (explained more fully in the section \u0026ldquo;Encapsulation and De-encapsulation\u0026rdquo;). If any translation between formats is required, this layer will take care of the translation. Layer 6 also communicates the type of data within the packet and the application that might be required to read it on the destination device.\nThis layer consists of two sublayers: the common application service element (CASE) sublayer and the specific application service element (SASE) sublayer. CASE provides services to the Application layer and requests services from the Session layer. SASE supports application-specific services.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "Which of the following BEST illustrates the difference of sending data by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as against User Datagram Protocol (UDP)?",
        "explanation":  "The following are examples of the functionality provided with TCP:\n\nGuaranteed delivery: If the receiving host does not specifically acknowledge receipt of each packet, the sending system will resend the packet.\n\nAccurate delivery: A checksum is generated using an algorithm. This algorithm produces a cryptographic hash function that represents a piece of data or a file. With TCP, if the receiving computer identifies a mismatch in the hash value that it receives, then it knows that the content of the message has changed during transmission. Thus, a checksum is critical to ensuring accurate delivery.\n\nSequencing: In today\u0026rsquo;s routed networks, the packets might take many different routes to arrive and might not arrive in the order in which they were sent. A sequence number added to each packet allows the receiving host to reassemble the entire transmission using these numbers.\n\nFlow control: The receiving host has the capability of sending the acknowledgment packets back to signal the sender to slow the transmission if it cannot process the packets as fast as they are arriving.\n\nMany applications do not require the services provided by TCP or cannot tolerate the overhead required by TCP. In these cases, the process will use UDP, which transmits data on a \u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo; basis with no guarantee of delivery or retransmission of missing packets. In many cases, some of these functions are provided by the Application layer protocol itself rather than relying on the Transport layer protocol.",

        "explanation":  "File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and the more secure versions FTPS and SFTP transfer files from one system to another. FTP is insecure in that the username and password are transmitted in cleartext. The original cleartext version uses TCP port 20 for data and TCP port 21 as the control channel. For this reason, using the original cleartext version of FTP is not recommended when security is a prime consideration.\nFTPS is a variation of FTP that adds support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols. FTPS uses TCP ports 989 and 990.\nFTPS is not the same as and should not be confused with another secure version of FTP, SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). This is an extension of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. There have been a number of different versions, with version 6 being the latest. Because it uses SSH for the file transfer, it uses TCP port 22.\nTrivial FTP (TFTP) does not use authentication and runs over UDP port 69.\n\u0026nbsp;",

It includes the following components:\n\nAuthentication Header (AH): Provides data integrity, data origin authentication, and protection from replay attacks.\n\nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP): Provides all that AH does as well as data confidentiality.\n\nInternet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP): Handles the creation of a security association for the session and the exchange of keys.\n\nInternet Key Exchange (IKE), also sometimes referred to as IPsec Key Exchange: Provides the authentication material used to create the keys exchanged by ISAKMP during peer authentication. This was proposed to be performed by a protocol called Oakley that relied on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, but Oakley has been superseded by IKE.\n\nIPsec is a framework, which means it does not specify many of the components used with it. These components must be identified in the configuration, and they must match for the two ends to successfully create the required security association (SA) that must be in place before any data is transferred.",

The modulation technique used in wireless had a huge impact on throughput. In the case of DSSS, it spreads the transmission across the spectrum at the same time as opposed to hopping from one to another as in FHSS. This allows it to attain up to 11 Mbps.",

        "explanation":  "Shorthand for Writing IPv6 Addresses\n\nAccording to NIST SP 800-119, IPv6 addresses do not lend themselves to human memorization due to their length. Administrators of IPv4 networks typically can recall multiple IPv4 network and host addresses; remembering multiple IPv6 network and host addresses is more challenging. The notation for IPv6 addresses may be compressed and simplified under specific circumstances.\n\nOne to three zeros that appear as the leading digits in any colon-delimited hexadecimal grouping may be dropped. This simplifies the address and makes it easier to read and to write. For example,\n\n2001:0db8:0aba:02e5:0000:0ee9:0000:0444/48\n\nbecomes\n\n2001:db8:aba:2e5:0:ee9:0:444/48\n\nIt is important to note that trailing zeros may not be dropped because they have intrinsic place value in the address format.\n\nFurther efficiency is gained by combining all-zero portions of the address. Any colon-delimited portion of an address containing all zeros may be compressed so that nothing appears between the leading and trailing colons. For example,\n\n2001:0db8:0055:0000:cd23:0000:0000:0205/48\n\nbecomes\n\n2001:db8:55:0:cd23::205/48\n\nIn this example, the sixth and seventh 16-bit groupings contain all zeros; they were compressed by eliminating the zeros completely, as well as the colon that divided the two groupings. Nevertheless, compressing an address by removing one or more consecutive colons between groups of zeros may be done only once per address. The fourth 16-bit grouping in the example also contains all zeros, but in the condensed form of the address, it is represented with a single zero. A choice had to be made as to which group of zeros was to be compressed. The sample address could be written\n\n2001:db8:55::cd23:0:0:205/48\n\nbut this is not as efficient as\n\n2001:db8:55:0:cd23::205/48",

It is considered a Physical layer device because it has no intelligence. When a hub receives traffic, it broadcasts that traffic out of every port because it lacks intelligence to make any decisions about where the destination is located or what is included in the traffic.\nAlthough this broadcast results in more collisions and poor performance, from a security standpoint, the problem is that the hub broadcasts all traffic to all ports.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "Transport Layer\n\nThe Transport layers of the OSI model and the TCP/IP model perform the same function, which is to open and maintain a connection between hosts. This connection must be established before the session between the processes can occur, as described in the \u0026ldquo;Application Layer\u0026rdquo; section, and can be done in TCP/IP in two ways: connectionless and connection-oriented. A connection-oriented transmission means that a connection will be established before any data is transferred, whereas in a connectionless transmission this is not done. One of two different transport layer protocols is used for each process. If a connection-oriented transport protocol is required, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used. If the process is connectionless, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used.\n\nApplication developers can choose to use either TCP or UDP as the Transport layer protocol used with the application. Regardless of which transport protocol is used, the application or service will be identified to the receiving device by its port number and the transport protocol (UDP or TCP).",

        "explanation":  "The listed firewall types are defined as follows: Proxy firewall: Hides a packet\u0026#39;s true origin before sending it through another network. Bastion host: Is a hardened system that usually resides on a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and is accessed frequently. Stateful firewall: Forwards packets on behalf of the client. It examines each packet and permits or denies it passage based on many factors, including the state table. Packet-filtering firewall:-Forwards packets based on rules that define which traffic is permitted and denied on the network.",

These packets never come and at some point the resources of the receiving computer are exhausted, making this a form of DoS attack. Session highjacking attack: The hacker attempts to place himself in the middle of an active conversation between two computers for the purpose of taking over the session of one of the two computers thus receiving all data sent to that computer. Port scan: Pings every address and port number combination and keeps track of which ports are open on each device as the pings are answered by open ports with listening services and not answered by closed ports. IP address spoofing: One of techniques used by hackers to hide their trail or to masquerade as another computer. The hacker alters the IP address as it appears in the packet.",

Using digital signatures and mutual authentication can help prevent this type of attack. Mail bombing: E-mail servers and clients are overwhelmed with unrequested e-mail messages. E-mail filtering and e-mail relay can help prevent this type of attack. Wardialing: Hackers dial a large bank of phone numbers to determine which is connected to a computer. Keeping telephone numbers private and implementing tight access control can help prevent this type of attack. Ping-of-death: Oversized ICMP packets are sent to the victim computer. To prevent this type of attack, you should stay up to date with system patches and implement ingress filtering.",

        "explanation":  "When an application is written and uses TCP, a state of connection is established between two hosts before any data is transferred. This connection is established using a process known as the TCP three-way handshake. This process is followed exactly, and no data is transferred until it is complete. Figure 4-4 shows the steps in this process. The steps are as follows:\n\n\n\tThe initiating computer sends a packet with the SYN flag set (one of the fields in the TCP header), which indicates a desire to create a connection.\n\tThe receiving host acknowledges receiving this packet and indicates a willingness to create a state of connection by sending back a packet with both the SYN and ACK flags set.\n\tThe first host acknowledges completion of the connection process by sending a final packet back with only the ACK flag set.",

        "explanation":  "Signature-based: This type of IDS analyzes traffic and compares it to attack or state patterns, called signatures, that reside within the IDS database. It is also referred to as a misuse-detection system. Although this type of IDS is popular, it can only recognize attacks as compared with its database and is only as effective as the signatures provided. Frequent updates are necessary. The two main types of signature-based IDSs are\n\nPattern-matching: The IDS compares traffic to a database of attack patterns. The IDS carries out specific steps when it detects traffic that matches an attack pattern.\n\nStateful-matching: The IDS records the initial operating system state. Any changes to the system state that specifically violate the defined rules result in an alert or notification being sent.",

        "explanation":  "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a service that can be used to automate the process of assigning an IP configuration to the devices in the network. A DHCP server uses the bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) to perform its functions. Manual configuration of an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server is not only time consuming but fraught with opportunity for human error. Using DHCP can not only automate this but can also eliminate network problems from this human error.\nDHCP is a client/server program. All modern operating systems contain a DHCP client, and the server component can be implemented either on a server or on a router. When a computer that is configured to be a DHCP client starts, it performs a precise four-step process to obtain its configuration. Conceptually, the client broadcasts for the IP address of the DHCP server. All devices receive this broadcast, but only DHCP servers respond. The device accepts the configuration offered by the first DHCP server from which it hears. The process uses four packets with distinctive names (see Figure 4-29). DHCP uses UDP ports 67 and 68. Port 67 sends data to the server, and port 68 sends data to the client.\n\u0026nbsp;",

The NAT service changes the private IP address to a public address that is routable on the Internet.

        "explanation":  "Some important points about Compute Express Link (CXL) that security professional should know include:\n\n\n\tHigh-speed, efficient connectivity: CXL provides a means to securely connect CPUs to high-speed, low-latency devices and memory systems. It enables better performance for data-intensive applications, which is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and security in environments where rapid data processing and analysis are required.\n\tResource sharing and coherency: CXL\u0026#39;s support for coherent memory access between the CPU and connected devices allows for more efficient resource utilization. This coherency is vital for ensuring that data is consistently and accurately shared across different components, reducing the risk of data corruption or loss and enhancing the overall integrity of the system.\n\tConvergence of protocols: Just like iSCSI allows SCSI commands to be transmitted over IP networks, and InfiniBand over Ethernet provides high-throughput, low-latency networking, CXL represents another step towards the convergence of high-performance computing and networking technologies. This convergence requires a deep understanding of how to secure mixed environments where traditional network traffic and high-performance interconnects coexist.\n\tSecurity considerations: While CXL focuses on performance and efficiency, integrating it into network architectures requires careful consideration of security implications, such as protecting against unauthorized access to shared memory resources and ensuring the integrity of data in transit between the CPU and CXL-enabled devices. Security controls and protocols need to be adapted to address these high-speed interconnects\u0026#39; unique characteristics.",

        "explanation":  "The listed firewall types are defined as follows: Proxy firewall: Hides a packet\u0026#39;s true origin before sending it through another network. Bastion host: Is a hardened system that usually resides on a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and is accessed frequently. Stateful firewall: Forwards packets on behalf of the client. It examines each packet and permits or denies it passage based on many factors, including the state table. Packet-filtering firewall:-Forwards packets based on rules that define which traffic is permitted and denied on the network.",

        "explanation":  "The beginning of a packet is called the header, and the end of the packet is called the trailer. The data between the header and the trailer is commonly referred to as the payload. In either model, as the packet is created, information is added to the header at each layer, and then a trailer is placed on the packet before transmission. This process is called encapsulation. Intermediate devices, such as routers and switches, read only the layers of concern to that device (for a switch, Layer 2, and for a router, Layer 3). The ultimate receiver strips off the entire header with each layer, making use of the information placed in the header by the corresponding layer on the sending device. This process is called de-encapsulation. In fact, de-encapsulation is just the opposite process of unpacking the data from the capsule.",

        "explanation":  "IP addresses that are written in dotted-decimal format, the format in which humans usually work with them, have four fields called octets separated by dots or periods. Each field is called an octet because, with addresses in binary format, 8 bits in binary represent each decimal number that appears in the octet when it is viewed in dotted-decimal format. Therefore, in the address 216.5.41.3, four decimal numbers are separated by dots, where each would be represented by 8 bits if viewed in binary. The following is the binary version of this same address:\n\n11011000.00000101.00101001.00000011\n\nThere are 32 bits in the address, or 8 in each of the four octets.\n\nThe structure of IPv4 addressing lends itself to dividing the network into subdivisions called subnets.",

        "explanation":  "Another element of 5G is D2D. Device-to-device (D2D) communication is technology that enables user equipment (UE) to communicate with one another, with or without a network infrastructure. The UE can be a mobile device or can be vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The primary benefit of D2D communication is ultra-low latency. Another benefit of D2D is the reduction of network capacity issues, thereby enabling devices to communicate with each other without the need to connect with a network.",

        "explanation":  "ATM\n\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a cell-switching technology. It transfers fixed-size cells of 53 bytes rather than packets, and after a path is established, it uses the same path for the entire communication. The use of a fixed path makes performance more predictable, making it a good option for voice and video, which need such predictability. Where IP networks depend on the source and destination devices to ensure data is properly transmitted, this responsibility falls on the shoulders of the devices between the two in the ATM world.",

The Session layer is responsible for adding information to the packet that makes a communication session between a service or application on the source device possible with the same service or application on the destination device. Do not confuse this process with the one that establishes a session between the two physical devices. That occurs not at this layer but at Layers 3 (network) and 4 (transport). This session is built and closed after the physical session between the computers has taken place.",

        "explanation":  "The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a name or value assigned to identify the WLAN from other WLANs. The SSID either can be broadcast by the AP, as is done in a free mobile hotspot, or can be hidden. When it is hidden, a wireless station will have to be configured with a profile that includes the SSID to connect. Although some view hiding the SSID as a security measure, it is not an effective measure because hiding the SSID removes only one type of frame, the beacon frame, while it still exists in other frame types and can be easily learned by sniffing the wireless network",

        "explanation":  "Transport Layer\n\nThe Transport layers of the OSI model and the TCP/IP model perform the same function, which is to open and maintain a connection between hosts. This connection must be established before the session between the processes can occur, as described in the \u0026ldquo;Application Layer\u0026rdquo; section, and can be done in TCP/IP in two ways: connectionless and connection-oriented. A connection-oriented transmission means that a connection will be established before any data is transferred, whereas in a connectionless transmission this is not done. One of two different transport layer protocols is used for each process. If a connection-oriented transport protocol is required, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used. If the process is connectionless, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used.",

Fraggle: A DDoS attack with the same goal and method as the Smurf attack. In this attack an attacker sends a large amount of UDP echo traffic to an IP broadcast address, all of it having a fake source address. ICMP redirect: Alters the route table of the host that receives the redirect message. This will change the way packets are routed in the network.",

        "explanation":  "A content-distribution network (CDN), also referred to as a content delivery network, is a distributed network of servers that is usually located in multiple data centers connected over the Internet. The content contained on the CDN can include text, graphics, applications, streaming media, and other content that is critical to users. CDNs are highly scalable to allow owners to quickly adjust to the demands of the end users. CDN examples include Microsoft Azure CDN, Netflix video streaming, and Amazon CloudFront.\n\nCDNs use caching to distribute the static content to the CDN. When a request is sent, the geographically closest point of presence (POP) to the requestor provides the cached static content. During the transaction, the POP queries the server for updated content. When content that has not been cached on local servers is requested, the CDN will request the content from the origin server and save a cached copy.",

        "explanation":  "Transmission media, cabling\n\nCables can be compared to one another using several criteria. One of the criteria that is important with networking is the cable\u0026rsquo;s susceptibility to attenuation. Attenuation occurs when the signal meets resistance as it travels through the cable. This weakens the signal, and at some point, the signal is no longer strong enough either to reach the destination or read properly at the destination. For this reason, all cables have a maximum length for a good signal strength. This is true regardless of whether the cable is fiber optic or electrical.",

        "explanation":  "The listed attacks are defined as follows: SYN ACK attack: The hacker sends a large number of packets with the SYN flag set, which causes the receiving computer to set aside memory for each ACK packet it expects to receive in return. These packets never come, and at some point the resources of the receiving computer are exhausted, making this a form of a DoS attack. Session highjacking attack: The hacker attempts to place himself in the middle of an active conversation between two computers for the purpose of taking over the session of one of the two computers, thus receiving all data sent to that computer. Port scan: Pings every address and port number combination and keeps track of which ports are open on each device as the pings are answered by open ports with listening services and not answered by closed ports. IP address spoofing: One of the techniques used by hackers to hide their trail or to masquerade as another computer. The hacker alters the IP address as it appears in the packet.",

When 802.1X authentication is used, the access point opens a virtual port for communication. If authorization is unsuccessful, the virtual port is unavailable, and communication is blocked. There are three basic entities during 802.1X authentication:\n\nSupplicant: A software client running on the Wi-Fi workstation\n\nAuthenticator: The wireless access point\n\nAuthentication server (AS): A server that contains an authentication database, usually a RADIUS server",

        "questionText":  "How appropriately does a Network Access Control System\u0026nbsp; (NACS) help provide security to a corporate network used by several end users?",
        "explanation":  "Network Access Control (NAC) systems allow organizations to enforce security policies to endpoints across the network. With the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart thermostats and camera, new Internet connected medical devices, there are more and more devices connecting to organizational networks, which puts their networks at risk \u0026ndash; especially since many of these devices are inherently insecure and maintain poor security protocols. Additionally, organizations allow more personal devices (mobile phones and tablets), referred to as BYOD to access their network resources, which adds to the organization\u0026rsquo;s network security risk. NAC allows the organization to implement an enterprise security strategy that applies to IoT and BYOD. Consequently, an NAC system can deny IoT and BYOD devices access to network devices, or limited access to network resources, if they are deemed non-compliant with the organization\u0026rsquo;s security policies, thereby reducing risk. Often a NAC system will allow a device to access the enterprise network once it becomes compliant with mandated protocols. For example, a mobile device updates its operating system or mobile application (app) to the latest version. NAC systems do not just profile and examine the device connecting to its network but also profile the user of the device \u0026ndash; meaning that there are different access privileges for employees versus contractors versus vendors versus partners or visitors.",

        "explanation":  "The listed attacks are defined as follows: SYN ACK attack: The hacker sends a large number of packets with the SYN flag set, which causes the receiving computer to set aside memory for each ACK packet it expects to receive in return. These packets never come, and at some point the resources of the receiving computer are exhausted, making this a form of a DoS attack. Session highjacking attack: The hacker attempts to place himself in the middle of an active conversation between two computers for the purpose of taking over the session of one of the two computers, thus receiving all data sent to that computer. Port scan: Pings every address and port number combination and keeps track of which ports are open on each device as the pings are answered by open ports with listening services and not answered by closed ports. IP address spoofing: One of the techniques used by hackers to hide their trail or to masquerade as another computer. The hacker alters the IP address as it appears in the packet.",

There are eight fields separated by colons, not dots.\n\nHere is a sample IPv6 address:\n\n2001:00000:4137:9e76:30ab:3035:b541:9693\n\nMany of the security features that were add-ons to IPv4 (such as IPsec) have been built into IPv6, providing better security. Moreover, while DHCP can be used with IPv6, IPv6 enables a host to locate its local router, configure itself, and discover the IP addresses of its neighbors. Finally, broadcast traffic is completely eliminated in IPv6 and replaced by multicast communications.",

The service provided can be either connection-oriented or connectionless, depending on the transport protocol in use. The \u0026ldquo;TCP/IP Model\u0026rdquo; section (TCP/IP being the most common standard networking protocol suite in use) discusses the specific transport protocols used by TCP/IP in detail.\nThe Transport layer receives all the information from Layers 7, 6, and 5 and adds information that identifies the transport protocol in use and the specific port number that identifies the required Layer 7 protocol. At this layer, the PDU is called a segment because this layer takes a large transmission and segments it into smaller pieces for more efficient transmission on the medium.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "All data transfers use a communication channel. Multiple transmissions might need to use the same channel. This medium can be shared in two different ways: using broadband or baseband. The difference is in how the medium is shared.\n\nIn baseband, the entire medium is used for a single transmission, and then multiple transmission types are assigned time slots to use this single circuit. This process is called time-division multiplexing (TDM). Multiplexing is the process of using the same medium for multiple transmissions. The transmissions take turns rather than send at the same time.\n\nBroadband, on the other hand, divides the medium into different frequencies, a process called frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). This process has the benefit of allowing true simultaneous use of the medium.",

        "explanation":  "Open systems architecture can act as a blueprint or model for developers to work with. Various protocols operate at different layers of this model. A protocol is a set of rules; in this case, these are rules for communication between two systems. Some protocols depend on other protocols for services, and as such, these protocols operate in concert and allow transmissions to occur, much like the team at the post office that gets letters delivered. Some people sort, others deliver, and still others track lost shipments.",

This method also uses parity bits for the purpose of ensuring that each byte has not changed or been corrupted en route. This method introduces additional overhead to the transmission.\n\nSynchronous transmission uses a clocking mechanism to sync up the sender and receiver. Data is transferred in a stream of bits with no start, stop, or parity bits. This clocking mechanism is embedded into the Layer 2 protocol. It uses a different form of error checking such as cyclic redundancy check (or CRC) and is preferable for high-speed, high-volume transmissions.",

        "explanation":  "Remember that any access control strategy and the system deployed to enforce it should avoid complexity. The more complex an access control system is, the harder that system is to manage. In addition, anticipating security issues that could occur in more complex systems is much harder. As a security professional, you must balance the organization\u0026rsquo;s security needs and policies with the needs of the users. If a security mechanism that you implement causes too much difficulty for the user, the user might engage in practices that subvert the mechanisms that you implement.",

        "explanation":  "Accounts, particularly user accounts, may need to be periodically transferred within an organization. This is most often the case when personnel move from one department or role to another. Procedures should be written so that the user account is granted the appropriate permissions for the new department or role. In addition, any unneeded permissions from the old department or role should be removed. Following this procedure ensures that privilege creep does not occur. Privilege creep, also referred to as permissions creep, occurs when an employee moves between roles in an organization and keeps the access or permissions of the previous role.",

The client sends a request to the authentication server (AS), which might or might not be the KDC. The AS forwards the client credentials to the KDC. The KDC authenticates clients to other entities on a network and facilitates communication using session keys. The KDC provides security to clients or principals, which are users, network services, and software. Each principal must have an account on the KDC. The KDC issues a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) to the principal. The principal will send the TGT to the ticket-granting service (TGS) when the principal needs to connect to another entity. The TGS then transmits a ticket and session keys to the principal. The set of principals for which a single KDC is responsible is referred to as a realm.",

Vulnerable devices are infected with software agents, called zombies. They turn the vulnerable devices into botnets, which then carry out the attack. Because of the geographically distributed bots and the very nature of the attack, identifying all the attacking botnets is virtually impossible. The botnets also help to hide the original source of the attack.",

E-mail filtering and e-mail relay can help prevent this type of attack. Wardialing: Hackers dial a large bank of phone numbers to determine which is connected to a computer. Keeping telephone numbers private and implementing tight access control can help prevent this type of attack. Ping-of-death: Oversized ICMP packets are sent to the victim computer. To prevent this type of attack, you should stay up to date with system patches and implement ingress filtering.",

        "explanation":  "The value of the information being protected will likely determine the controls that an organization is willing to deploy. For example, regular correspondence on a client computer will likely not require the same controls as financial data stored on a server. For the client computer, the organization may simply deploy a local software firewall and appropriate ACL permissions on the local folders and files. For the server, the organization may need to deploy more complex measures, including drive encryption, transport encryption, ACLs, and other measures.",

        "explanation":  "When it comes to servers, determining which access controls to deploy is usually a more complicated process. Security professionals should work with the server owner, whether it is a department head or an IT professional, to determine the value of the asset and the needed protection. Of course, most servers should be placed in a locked room that has restricted access. In many cases, this will be a data center or server room. However, servers can be deployed in regular locked offices if necessary. In addition, other controls should be deployed to ensure that the system is fully protected. The access control needs of a file server are different from those of a web server or database server. It is vital that the organization perform a thorough assessment of the data that is being processed and stored on the system before determining which access controls to deploy. If limited resources are available, security professionals must ensure that their most important systems have more access controls than other systems.",

        "explanation":  "Accounts, particularly user accounts, may need to be periodically transferred within an organization. This is most often the case when personnel move from one department or role to another. Procedures should be written so that the user account is granted the appropriate permissions for the new department or role. In addition, any unneeded permissions from the old department or role should be removed. Following this procedure ensures that privilege creep does not occur. Privilege creep, also referred to as permissions creep, occurs when an employee moves between roles in an organization and keeps the access or permissions of the previous role.",

One popular implementation requires a user to enter a series of characters in the graphic displayed. This implementation ensures that a human is entering the password, not a robot. Another popular implementation requires users to select the appropriate graphic for their accounts from a list of graphics shown to the users. The list changes dynamically every time a user tries to log in.",

Administrators should ensure that any existing permissions or rights that the user no longer needs are removed. For example, if a user is moving from the accounting department to the sales department, the user account should no longer have permissions or rights to accounting resources.",

This turns the vulnerable devices into botnets, which then carry out the attack. Devices that meet TEMPEST standards implement an outer barrier or coating, called a Faraday cage or Faraday shield. A backdoor or trapdoor is a mechanism implemented in many devices or applications that gives the user who uses the backdoor unlimited access to the device or application. Emanations are electromagnetic signals that are emitted by an electronic device. Attackers can target certain devices or transmission mediums to eavesdrop on communication without having physical access to the device or medium.",

        "explanation":  "Scrubbing is the act of deleting incriminating data within an audit log.\n\nAudit trails detect computer penetrations and reveal actions that identify misuse. As a security professional, you should use the audit trails to review patterns of access to individual objects. To identify abnormal patterns of behavior, you should first identify normal patterns of behavior. Also, you should establish the clipping level, which is a baseline of user errors above which violations will be recorded. For example, your organization might choose to ignore the first invalid login attempt, knowing that initial failed login attempts are often due to user error. Any further invalid login attempts after the first would be recorded because they could be a sign of an attack. A common clipping level that is used is three failed login attempts. For security purposes, any failed login attempt above the limit of three would be considered malicious. In most cases, a lockout policy would lock out a user\u0026rsquo;s account after this clipping level is reached.\n\nAudit trails deter attacker attempts to bypass the protection mechanisms that are configured on a system or device. As a security professional, you should specifically configure the audit trails to track system/device rights or privileges being granted to a user, and data additions, deletions, or modifications.",

Using an up-to-date hashing algorithm (versus one that is outdated) is the first step in protecting against this type of attack. Salting is the process of randomizing each hash by adding random data that is unique to each user to their password hash, so even the same password has a unique hash.",

        "explanation":  "An advanced persistent threat (APT) is an attack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a network and remains for a long period of time with the intention being to steal data. An APT does not aim to cause damage to the network or organization. Its main aim is to gain access to valuable information.\n\nAfter attackers gain access to the network, they usually set up a backdoor. To prevent discovery, the attackers may erase logs (also known as covering their tracks), rewrite code, and employ other sophisticated evasion techniques. Some APTs are so complex that they require a full-time administrator. The attackers will work to establish backdoors with each successful breach of an internal system.",

        "explanation":  "Time factor authentication authenticates a user based on the time and/or date the user is authenticating. For example, if certain users work only a set schedule, you can configure their accounts to allow them to log in only during those set work hours. However, keep in mind that such a limitation could cause administrative issues if overtime hours are allowed. Some organizations implement this type of authentication effectively by padding the allowed hours with an hour or two leeway for the start and end times. Credit cards use this feature effectively to protect their customers. If transactions take place in a short timeframe from geographically dispersed locations, credit cards will often block the second transaction.",

Data custodians or administrators will grant users permissions on a file or folder based on the owner\u0026rsquo;s request to do so. Rights allow administrators to assign specific privileges and logon rights to groups or users. Rights manage who is allowed to perform certain operations on an entire computer or within a domain, rather than a particular object within a computer. While user permissions are granted by an object\u0026rsquo;s owner, user rights are assigned using a computer\u0026rsquo;s local security policy or a domain security policy. User rights apply to user accounts, whereas permissions apply to objects.",

        "explanation":  "A hand geometry scan usually obtains size, shape, or other layout attributes of a user\u0026rsquo;s hand but can also measure bone length or finger length. Two categories of hand geometry systems are mechanical and image-edge detective systems. Regardless of which category is used, hand geometry scanners require less server space and processing time than fingerprint or finger scans.\n\nA hand topography scan records the peaks and valleys of the hand and its shape. This system is usually implemented in conjunction with hand geometry scans because hand topography scans are not unique enough if used alone.\n\nA palm or hand scan combines fingerprint and hand geometry technologies. It records fingerprint information from every finger as well as hand geometry information.",

        "explanation":  "When it comes to working with Linux, there are two ways to run administrative applications: (1) change over to the super user, also known as the root account, using the su command with a known password for the root or super user account, or (2) use the sudo command. With the sudo command, the user uses their regular or another user account but with root privilege. However, with the su command, the user is actually logged in to the root account. Also, the root privilege in the sudo command is valid only for a temporary amount of time. When that time expires, the user has to input a password again to regain root privilege.\n\nSecurity professionals should ensure that use of the su command is greatly restricted. While the sudo command is a better choice, users should still use it only when it is strictly necessary.",

        "explanation":  "Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) allows users to access multiple web applications using one set of login credentials, thereby providing SSO. It passes authentication data in a set format between two parties, usually an identity provider (IdP) and a web application. SAML uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.\n\nIn a comparison of SAML and OAuth, SAML provides more control to enterprises to keep their SSO logins more secure, whereas OAuth is better on mobile devices.",

If the authentication method requires a token device, the user must be in physical possession of the device to authenticate. So although the token device provides a password to the authentication server, the token device is considered an ownership authentication factor because its use requires ownership of the device.\n\nTwo basic token device authentication methods are used: synchronous or asynchronous. A synchronous token generates a unique password at fixed time intervals with the authentication server. An asynchronous token generates the password based on a challenge/response technique with the authentication server, with the token device providing the correct answer to the authentication server\u0026rsquo;s challenge.",

        "questionText":  "Over the past few years, your organization has merged several department networks into a single company network. As a result, each department has different methods for identity provisioning. Your company establishes a companywide provisioning policy to which all departments must transition. You have been asked to implement a solution that will allow users to use one account to log in to all systems across the departments. Which technology should you implement?",
        "explanation":  "You should implement single sign-on (SSO) to allow users to use a single account to log in to all systems across the departments. Discretionary access control (DAC) and role-based access control (RBAC) are two access control models. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are hardware or software controls that either detect or prevent network intrusions.",

An APT does not aim to cause damage to the network or organization.

To prevent discovery, the attackers may erase logs (also known as covering their tracks), rewrite code, and employ other sophisticated evasion techniques. Some APTs are so complex that they require a full-time administrator. The attackers will work to establish backdoors with each successful breach of an internal system.",

Vulnerable devices are infected with software agents, called zombies. They turn the vulnerable devices into botnets, which then carry out the attack. Because of the geographically distributed bots and the very nature of the attack, identifying all the attacking botnets is virtually impossible. The botnets also help to hide the original source of the attack.",

        "explanation":  "When it comes to working with Linux, there are two ways to run administrative applications: (1) change over to the super user, also known as the root account, using the su command with a known password for the root or super user account, or (2) use the sudo command. With the sudo command, the user uses their regular or another user account but with root privilege. However, with the su command, the user is actually logged in to the root account. Also, the root privilege in the sudo command is valid only for a temporary amount of time. When that time expires, the user has to input a password again to regain root privilege.\n\nSecurity professionals should ensure that use of the su command is greatly restricted. While the sudo command is a better choice, users should still use it only when it is strictly necessary.",

        "explanation":  "Applications are installed digitally on devices. Logical access involves controlling who can digitally access or install applications on a device. For organizations, these applications may require that security professionals use IAM solutions to permit or deny access to users and roles. Permission may be limited to using the application or may be as expansive as allowing the users to install applications. These applications may use enterprise IAM or an in-application mechanism. Security professionals may need to use group policies to control the ability to install the applications on Windows devices. Physical access to applications is a slightly different matter. Some applications are installed via digital media. Security professionals should ensure that the media is stored in a secured location, such as a locked filing cabinet. Physical access to an application can also be obtained by gaining physical access to a device on which the application is installed. Devices should be configured to enter sleep or standby mode after a certain amount of user inactivity. In addition, users should be trained to digitally lock their devices when they leave their desks. This would ensure that an unauthorized user is not able to access the application.",

Using an up-to-date hashing algorithm (versus one that is outdated) is the first step in protecting against this type of attack. Salting is the process of randomizing each hash by adding random data that is unique to each user to their password hash, so even the same password has a unique hash.",

        "explanation":  "A web application is a computer program that uses a web browser and web technologies to perform tasks on websites. Web applications reside on web servers. Examples of web applications include webmail and document sharing applications, such as Gmail and Google Docs. The benefit of using a web application is that the user does not need to download an application locally or be concerned about software updates. However, companies that utilize third-party web applications have little control over their security and depend on the vendor for patching vulnerabilities. Because web applications are widely used today, organizations must ensure that their web applications remain secure and free of vulnerabilities. Web application vulnerability scanners are special tools that examine web applications for known vulnerabilities.\n\nPopular web application vulnerability scanners include Grabber and Vega.",

        "explanation":  "Synthetic transaction monitoring, which is a type of proactive monitoring, is often preferred for websites and applications. It provides insight into the availability and performance of an application and warns of any potential issue before users experience any degradation in application behavior. It uses external agents to run scripted transactions against an application. For example, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s System Center Operations Manager uses synthetic transactions to monitor databases, websites, and TCP port usage.",

        "questionText":  "What types of vulnerability scanners are used in computer information security?",
        "explanation":  "There are two types of vulnerability scanners:\n\nPassive vulnerability scanners: A passive vulnerability scanner (PVS) monitors network traffic at the packet layer to determine topology, services, and vulnerabilities. It avoids the instability that can be introduced to a system by actively scanning for vulnerabilities.\n\nPVS tools analyze the packet stream and look for vulnerabilities through direct analysis. They are deployed in much the same way as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or packet analyzers. A PVS can pick a network session that targets a protected server and monitor it as much as needed. The biggest benefit of a PVS is its ability to do its work without impacting the monitored network. Some examples of PVSs are the Nessus Network Monitor (formerly Tenable PVS) and NetScanTools Pro.\n\nActive vulnerability scanners: Whereas passive scanners can only gather information, active vulnerability scanners (AVSs) can take action to block an attack, such as blocking a dangerous IP address. They can also be used to simulate an attack to assess readiness. They operate by sending transmissions to nodes and examining the responses. As a result, these scanners may disrupt network traffic. Active scanning should not begin until end users are notified about upcoming testing and the potential for network downtime. Examples include Nessus, Burp Suite, and IBM Security QRadar.\n\u0026nbsp;",

If no response is received, then the port is marked as filtered. If an RST response is received, then the port is marked as unfiltered.\n\nXmas scan: Sends a packet with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags set. If the port is open, there is no response. If the port is closed, the target responds with a RST/ACK packet.\n\nThe result of this type of scan is primarily for security professionals to determine whether ports are open that should be closed.\n\nThe most widely used network discovery scanning tool is Nmap",

        "explanation":  "Security assessment, testing, and auditing occur in three manners: internal, external, and third-party. \n\nInternal assessment, testing, and auditing are carried out by personnel within the organization. External assessment, testing, and auditing are carried out by a vendor or contractor that is engaged by the company.\n\nSometimes third-party assessment, testing, and auditing are performed by a party completely unrelated to the company and not previously engaged by it. This scenario often arises as a result of having to comply with some standard or regulation or when accreditation or certification is involved. Many certifying or regulating bodies may require engagement of a third party that has not had a previous relationship with the organization being assessed. In this case, the certifying body will work with the organization to engage an approved third party.",

        "explanation":  "Account management is important because it involves the addition and deletion of accounts that are granted access to systems or networks. But account management also involves changing the permissions or privileges granted to those accounts. If account management is not monitored and recorded properly, organizations may discover that accounts have been created by unauthorized persons or those with misused privileges for the sole purpose of carrying out fraudulent or malicious activities. Two-person controls should be used with account management, often involving one administrator who creates accounts and another who assigns those accounts the appropriate permissions or privileges.",

        "explanation":  "A log is a physical or electronic recording of events that occur on an organizational asset, including systems, networks, devices, and facilities. Each entry in a log covers a single event that occurs on the asset. In most cases, there are separate logs for different event types, including security logs, operating system logs, and application logs. Because so many logs are generated on a single device, many organizations have trouble ensuring that the logs are reviewed in a timely manner. Log review, however, is probably one of the most important steps an organization can take to ensure that issues are detected before they become major problems.",

        "explanation":  "Security information and event management (SIEM) products allow administrators to consolidate all security information logs. This consolidation ensures that administrators can perform analysis on all logs from a single resource rather than having to analyze each log on its separate resource. Most SIEM products support two ways of collecting logs from log generators:\nAgentless: The SIEM server receives data from the individual hosts without needing to have any special software installed on those hosts. Some servers pull logs from the hosts, which is usually done by having the server authenticate to each host and retrieve its logs regularly. In other cases, the hosts push their logs to the server, which usually involves each host authenticating to the server and transferring its logs regularly. Regardless of whether the logs are pushed or pulled, the server then performs event filtering and aggregation and log normalization and analysis on the collected logs.\nAgent-based: An agent program is installed on the host to perform event filtering and aggregation and log normalization for a particular type of log. The host then transmits the normalized log data to the SIEM server, usually on a real-time or near-real-time basis for analysis and storage. Multiple agents may need to be installed if a host has multiple types of logs of interest. Some SIEM products also offer agents for generic formats such as syslog and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A generic agent is used primarily to get log data from a source for which a format-specific agent and an agentless method are not available. Some products also allow administrators to create custom agents to handle unsupported log sources.\n\u0026nbsp;",

Moreover, if any of the relevant security patches have not been applied, the weaknesses the patches were intended to address will exist on the machine.

        "explanation":  "Security information and event management (SIEM) products allow administrators to consolidate all security information logs. This consolidation ensures that administrators can perform analysis on all logs from a single resource rather than having to analyze each log on its separate resource. Most SIEM products support two ways of collecting logs from log generators:\n\nAgentless: The SIEM server receives data from the individual hosts without needing to have any special software installed on those hosts. Some servers pull logs from the hosts, which is usually done by having the server authenticate to each host and retrieve its logs regularly. In other cases, the hosts push their logs to the server, which usually involves each host authenticating to the server and transferring its logs regularly. Regardless of whether the logs are pushed or pulled, the server then performs event filtering and aggregation and log normalization and analysis on the collected logs.\n\nAgent-based: An agent program is installed on the host to perform event filtering and aggregation and log normalization for a particular type of log. The host then transmits the normalized log data to the SIEM server, usually on a real-time or near-real-time basis for analysis and storage. Multiple agents may need to be installed if a host has multiple types of logs of interest. Some SIEM products also offer agents for generic formats such as syslog and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A generic agent is used primarily to get log data from a source for which a format-specific agent and an agentless method are not available. Some products also allow administrators to create custom agents to handle unsupported log sources.",

        "explanation":  "Security information and event management (SIEM) products usually include support for several dozen types of log sources, such as OSs, security software, application servers (e.g., web servers, email servers), and even physical security control devices such as badge readers. For each supported log source type, except for generic formats such as syslog, the SIEM products typically know how to categorize the most important logged fields. This approach significantly improves the normalization, analysis, and correlation of log data over that performed by software with a less granular understanding of specific log sources and formats. Also, the SIEM software can perform event reduction by disregarding data fields that are not significant to computer security, potentially reducing the SIEM software\u0026rsquo;s network bandwidth and data storage",

        "questionText":  "What is the MAIN purpose of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)?",
        "explanation":  "Security information and event management (SIEM) products allow administrators to consolidate all security information logs. This consolidation ensures that administrators can perform analysis on all logs from a single resource rather than having to analyze each log on its separate resource. Most SIEM products support two ways of collecting logs from log generators:\n\nAgentless: The SIEM server receives data from the individual hosts without needing to have any special software installed on those hosts. Some servers pull logs from the hosts, which is usually done by having the server authenticate to each host and retrieve its logs regularly. In other cases, the hosts push their logs to the server, which usually involves each host authenticating to the server and transferring its logs regularly. Regardless of whether the logs are pushed or pulled, the server then performs event filtering and aggregation and log normalization and analysis on the collected logs.\n\nAgent-based: An agent program is installed on the host to perform event filtering and aggregation and log normalization for a particular type of log. The host then transmits the normalized log data to the SIEM server, usually on a real-time or near-real-time basis for analysis and storage. Multiple agents may need to be installed if a host has multiple types of logs of interest. Some SIEM products also offer agents for generic formats such as syslog and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A generic agent is used primarily to get log data from a source for which a format-specific agent and an agentless method are not available. Some products also allow administrators to create custom agents to handle unsupported log sources.",

The organization is not concerned with cost. Its primary concern is that the site is recoverable in the least amount of time. Which of the following alternative site strategies should the organization implement?",
        "explanation":  "A redundant site provides a site that is recoverable in the least amount of time and will allow the organization to have the most control of the resources. A redundant site is owned by the organization that owns the computer resources. A redundant site is expensive to implement. A hot site is not owned by the organization that owns the resources. This alternative site will not allow the organization to have the most control of the resources. A warm site and a cold site are not owned by the organization that owns the resources. In addition, these two site types take more time to recover than redundant sites and hot sites. A tertiary site is a site that acts as a backup to the hot, warm, or cold site. It usually takes much longer to recover a tertiary site than a hot site or redundant site.",

Clustering: The process of providing failover capabilities for servers by using multiple servers together. A cluster consists of several servers providing the same services. If one server in the cluster fails, the other servers will continue to operate. Cold site: For disaster recovery includes a basic room with raised flooring, electrical wiring, air conditioning, and telecommunications lines. To properly test disaster recovery procedures at the cold site, alternative telecommunications and computer equipment would need to be set up and configured. Server redundancy: Ensures that each server has another server that can operate in its place should the original server fail. Clustering is a form of server redundancy. Warm site: A leased facility that contains electrical and communications wiring, full utilities, and networking equipment. In most cases, the only devices that are not included in a warm site are the computers. Hot site: A leased facility that contains all the resources needed for full operation.",

Preservation: Focuses on preserving original artifacts in a way that is reliable, complete, accurate, and verifiable. Cryptographic hashing, checksums, and documentation are all key components of the preservation phase. Analysis or Filtering: Investigators will attempt to filter out data, which is determined not to contain any artifacts of evidentiary value. Presentation: Potential artifacts of evidentiary value are presented normally starting with the investigator extracting the artifacts from the original media and then staging and organizing them on CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.",

It involves the use of redundant components or facilities. Quality of service (QoS) is a technology that manages network resources to ensure a predefined level of service. It assigns traffic priorities to the different types of traffic on a network. A recovery time objective (RTO) stipulates the amount of time an organization needs to recover from a disaster, and a recovery point objective (RPO) stipulates the amount of data an organization can lose when a disaster occurs.",

        "explanation":  "With regard to allowing access to resources and assigning rights to perform operations, always apply the concept of least privilege (also called need to know). In the context of resource access, that means that the default level of access should be no access. Give users access only to resources required to do their job, and that access should require manual implementation after the requirement is verified by a supervisor.\n\nDiscretionary access control (DAC) and role-based access control (RBAC) are examples of systems based on a user\u0026rsquo;s need to know. To ensure least privilege requires that the user\u0026rsquo;s job be identified and each user be granted the lowest clearance required for their tasks. Another example is the implementation of views in a database. Need to know requires that the operator have the minimum knowledge of the system necessary to perform a task.",

RAID 1: Also called disk mirroring it uses two disks and writes a copy of the data to both disks, providing fault tolerance in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 2: In this system the data is striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level as in RAID 3 and RAID 5. RAID 3: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is written to a single dedicated drive. The parity information is used to regenerate the data in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 5: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is written across the drives.",

        "explanation":  "The listed detection system operate in the following ways: Passive infrared systems (PIR): Detection systems that operate by identifying changes in heat waves in an area. Electromechanical systems: Detection systems that operate by detecting a break in an electrical circuit. For example, the circuit may cross a window or door, and when the window or door is opened, the circuit is broken setting off an alarm of some sort. Photometric system: Or photoelectric system operates by detecting changes in the light and therefore is used in windowless areas. It sends a beam of light across the area, and if the beam is interrupted ( by a person for example) the alarm is triggered. Acoustical systems: Detection systems that use strategically placed microphones to detect any sound made during a forced entry. Wave motion detector: These devices generate a wave pattern in the area and detect any motion that disturbs the excepted wave pattern. When the pattern is disturbed, an alarm sounds. Capacitance detector: These devices emit a magnetic field and monitor that field. If the field is disrupted, which occurs when a person enters the area, the alarm sounds.",

        "explanation":  "Threat intelligence is threat information that allows organizations to implement controls to protect against the threats. A threat intelligence feed (TI feed), also referred to as a threat feed, is an ongoing stream of data related to identified potential threats to an organization\u0026rsquo;s security, usually provided by threat intelligence sources. Threat intelligence sources include open-source intelligence (OSINT), social media intelligence, human intelligence, and technical intelligence, including intelligence from the dark web. Threat hunting is a cyber defense activity that proactively and iteratively searches networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. The actual process of threat hunting is beyond the scope of the CISSP exam with its management focus. Threat hunting requires that an organization employs an experienced cybersecurity analyst or firm to use manual or machine-based techniques to proactively identify threats that currently deployed automated detection methods did not catch.",

        "explanation":  "Job Rotation and Mandatory Vacation\n\nFrom a security perspective, job rotation refers to the training of multiple users to perform the duties of a position to help prevent fraud by any individual employee. The idea is that by making more than one person familiar with the legitimate functions of the position, the higher the likelihood that unusual activities by any one person will be noticed. This approach is often used in conjunction with mandatory vacations, in which all users are required to take time off, allowing another to fill their position while gone, which enhances the opportunity to discover unusual activity. Beyond the security aspects of job rotation, additional benefits include\n\nTrained backup in case of emergencies\n\nProtection against fraud\n\nCross training of employees\n\nRotation of duties, separation of duties, and mandatory vacations are all administrative controls.",

        "explanation":  "The listed terms are defined as follows: Fault tolerance: Ensures that you have the required number of components plus one extra to plug into any system in case of failure. Clustering: The process of providing failover capabilities for servers by using multiple servers together. A cluster consists of several servers providing the same services. If one server in the cluster fails, the other servers will continue to operate. Cold site: For disaster recovery includes a basic room with raised flooring, electrical wiring, air conditioning, and telecommunications lines. To properly test disaster recovery procedures at the cold site, alternative telecommunications and computer equipment would need to be set up and configured. Server redundancy: Ensures that each server has another server that can operate in its place should the original server fail. Clustering is a form of server redundancy. Warm site: A leased facility that contains electrical and communications wiring, full utilities, and networking equipment. In most cases, the only devices that are not included in a warm site are the computers. Hot site: A leased facility that contains all the resources needed for full operation.",

        "explanation":  "The listed terms are defined as follows: Fault tolerance: Ensures that you have the required number of components plus one extra to plug into any system in case of failure. Clustering: The process of providing failover capabilities for servers by using multiple servers together. A cluster consists of several servers providing the same services. If one server in the cluster fails, the other servers will continue to operate. Cold site: For disaster recovery includes a basic room with raised flooring, electrical wiring, air conditioning, and telecommunications lines. To properly test disaster recovery procedures at the cold site, alternative telecommunications and computer equipment would need to be set up and configured. Server redundancy: Ensures that each server has another server that can operate in its place should the original server fail. Clustering is a form of server redundancy. Warm site: A leased facility that contains electrical and communications wiring, full utilities, and networking equipment. In most cases, the only devices that are not included in a warm site are the computers. Hot site: A leased facility that contains all the resources needed for full operation.",

After the crime scene has been identified, steps should be taken to ensure that the environment is protected, including both the physical and virtual environment. To secure the physical crime scene, an investigator might need to isolate the systems involved by removing them from a network. However, the systems should not be powered down until the investigator is sure that all digital evidence has been captured.

        "explanation":  "You should implement a tertiary site because this site will provide a backup in case the primary alternative site is unavailable. A cold site does not contain any computers or telecommunications equipment. It does contain wiring, heating and air, and raised flooring. It is much cheaper than a hot site. However, it takes much longer to recover. A warm site contains telecommunications equipment but no computers and is cheaper than a hot site but more expensive than a cold site. It takes longer to recover than a hot site but shorter to recover than a cold site. A hot site contains telecommunications and computer and is the most expensive alternative site. It takes the shortest amount of time to recover. A tertiary site provides an alternative in case the hot site, warm site, or cold site is unavailable.",

Preserving and collecting evidence: Involves making system images, implementing chain of custody documenting the evidence, and recording timestamps. Examining evidence: Characteristics, such as timestamps and identification properties, should be determined and documented. After the evidence has been fully analyzed using scientific methods, the full incident should be reconstructed and documented. Present findings The evidence must be presented as evidence in court. In most cases when presenting evidence in court, it is best to present the findings in a format the audience can understand. Decision: The guilt or innocence of the accused party is determined.",

        "explanation":  "You should implement a hot site because this site will allow you to recovery as quickly as possible. A cold site does not contain any computers or telecommunications equipment. It does contain wiring, heating and air, and raised flooring. It is much cheaper than a hot site. However, it takes much longer to recover. A warm site contains telecommunications equipment but no computers and is cheaper than a hot site but more expensive than a cold site. It takes longer to recover than a hot site but shorter to recover than a cold site. A tertiary site provides an alternate in case the hot site, warm site, or cold site is unavailable.",

Clustering: The process of providing failover capabilities for servers by using multiple servers together. A cluster consists of several servers providing the same services. If one server in the cluster fails, the other servers will continue to operate. Cold site: For disaster recovery includes a basic room with raised flooring, electrical wiring, air conditioning, and telecommunications lines. To properly test disaster recovery procedures at the cold site, alternative telecommunications and computer equipment would need to be set up and configured. Server redundancy: Ensures that each server has another server that can operate in its place should the original server fail. Clustering is a form of server redundancy. Warm site: A leased facility that contains electrical and communications wiring, full utilities, and networking equipment. In most cases, the only devices that are not included in a warm site are the computers. Hot site: A leased facility that contains all the resources needed for full operation.",

One copy of the image will be stored to ensure that an undamaged, accurate copy is available as evidence. The other copy will be used during the examination and analysis steps. Message digests should be used to ensure data integrity.",

        "explanation":  "The concept of separation of duties prescribes that sensitive operations be divided among multiple users so that no one user has the rights and access to carry out the operation alone. Separation of duties and responsibilities is valuable in deterring fraud by ensuring that no single individual can compromise a system. It is considered a preventive administrative control. An example would be one person initiating a request for a payment and another authorizing that payment to be made",

        "explanation":  "User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), also known as user behavior analytics (UBA), is the process of gathering data regarding daily user network events so that normal conduct by users is understood. Organizations can use UEBA to detect compromised credentials, lateral movement, and other malicious behavior. UEBA are often added on as a layer to existing SIEM deployments. The key to UEBA is detecting behavior anomalies that could be indicative of a threat.",

        "explanation":  "The redundancy methods are defined as follows: RAID 0: Also called disk striping, this method writes the data across multiple drives, but although it improves performance, it does not provide fault tolerance. RAID 1: Also called disk mirroring, it uses two disks and writes a copy of the data to both disks, providing fault tolerance in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 2: In this system the data is striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level. RAID 3: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping and then parity information is written to a single dedicated drive; the parity information is used to regenerate the data in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 5: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is also distributed across all drives. RAID 7: Although not a standard but a proprietary implementation, this system incorporates the same principles as RAID 5 but enables the drive array to continue to operate if any disk or any path to any disk fails. The multiple disks in the array operate as a single virtual disk.",

The chain of custody must be maintained, as described later in the chapter. Computer evidence is less likely to be admitted in court as evidence if the process for producing the evidence has not been properly documented.",

Even if an attacker gains physical access to the storage media, the data will remain protected if encrypted properly.\n\tAccess Controls: Implementing robust access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. This includes the use of strong authentication methods and permissions settings that restrict access based on user roles.\n\tData Masking: Applying data masking techniques to hide sensitive information within a dataset, ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot view the actual data even if they can access the dataset.\n\tPhysical Security Ensuring physical security measures are in place to protect the storage media from theft, tampering, or destruction. This includes secure facilities, locked storage cabinets, and surveillance systems.",

Preserving and collecting evidence: Involves making system images, implementing chain of custody documenting the evidence, and recording timestamps. Examining evidence: Characteristics, such as timestamps and identification properties, should be determined and documented. After the evidence has been fully analyzed using scientific methods, the full incident should be reconstructed and documented. Present findings The evidence must be presented as evidence in court. In most cases when presenting evidence in court, it is best to present the findings in a format the audience can understand. Decision: The guilt or innocence of the accused party is determined.",

Relevant means that it must prove a material fact related to the crime in that it shows a crime has been committed, can provide information describing the crime, can provide information regarding the perpetrator\u0026rsquo;s motives, or can verify what occurred. Legally permissible means that evidence is deemed by the judge to be useful in helping the jury or judge reach a decision and cannot be objected to on the basis that it is irrelevant, immaterial, or violates the rules against hearsay and other objections. Reliability means that it has not been tampered with or modified. Properly identified means that the evidence is labeled appropriately and entered into the evidence log.

        "explanation":  "Identify Evidence\n\nThe first step in any forensic investigation is to identify and secure the crime scene and identify the evidence. The evidence is identified by reviewing audit logs, monitoring systems, analyzing user complaints, and analyzing detection mechanisms. Initially, the investigators might be unsure of which evidence is important. Preserving evidence that you might not need, which is the next step in the process, is always better than wishing you had evidence that you did not retain. Therefore, a logical first step in any investigation is identifying the evidence and securing the crime scene.\n\nIn digital investigations, the attacked system is considered the crime scene. In some cases, the system from which the attack originated can also be considered part of the crime scene. However, fully capturing the attacker\u0026rsquo;s systems may not always be possible. For this reason, you should ensure that you capture any data, such as IP addresses, usernames, and other identifiers, that can point to a specific system.",

        "explanation":  "After any investigation is over, security professionals should provide reports and documentation to management regarding the incident. This report should be presented to management as quickly as possible so that management can determine whether controls need to be implemented to prevent the incident. This submission to management will often happen prior to the presentation of any legal findings in a court of law. Organizations should establish procedures for ensuring that individuals to whom the reports are submitted have the appropriate clearance. It may also be necessary to redact certain parts of the report to ensure that any criminal cases are not negatively affected.\nAlthough internal reporting is important, security professionals should also have guidelines for when to report incidents to law enforcement. The earlier that law enforcement is involved, the more likely that evidence will be admissible in a court of law. However, most local law enforcement personnel do not have the knowledge or skills to carry out a full digital investigation. If the organization does not have properly trained personnel, a forensic investigator will need to be called in to perform the investigation. Legal professionals should also be brought in to help.\nProper documentation must be maintained throughout the investigation and include logs, chain of custody forms, and documented procedures and guidelines.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "The redundancy methods are defined as follows: RAID 0: Also called disk striping, this method writes the data across multiple drives, but although it improves performance, its does not provide fault tolerance. RAID 1: Also called disk mirroring, it uses two disks and writes a copy of the data to both disks, providing fault tolerance in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 2: In this system the data is striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level. RAID 3: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is written to a single dedicated drive. The parity information is used to regenerate the data in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 5: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is also distributed across all drives. RAID 7: Although not a standard but a proprietary implementation, this system incorporates the same principles as RAID 5 but enables the drive array to continue to operate if any disk or any path to any disk fails. The multiple disks in the array operate as a single virtual disk.",

        "explanation":  "Security logs record access to resources, including access to files, folders, and printers. They can record when a user accesses, modifies, or deletes a file or folder. Although most systems will record when key files are accessed, it is often necessary for an administrator to enable auditing on other resources, such as data folders or network printers. When auditing is running on a device, it will affect the performance of that device. For this reason, security professionals should configure auditing only when necessary based on the organization\u0026rsquo;s security policies.",

You do not need to update the plan after applying service packs and patches. This is a normal event that should not cause any changes in the plan. You do not need to update after a user receives a promotion to another position in the organization. The plan is tied to organizational roles, not specific users. If a user receives a promotion, he will need to be trained on any changes in his job role. You do not need to update the plan when an emergency response facility is located closer to your organization\u0026rsquo;s location. Although this may affect the response time of the emergency team, it should not have any effect on your internal plans.",

Preservation: Focuses on preserving original artifacts in a way that is reliable, complete, accurate, and verifiable. Cryptographic hashing, checksums, and documentation are all key components of the preservation phase. Analysis or Filtering: Investigators will attempt to filter out data, which is determined not to contain any artifacts of evidentiary value. Presentation: Potential artifacts of evidentiary value are presented normally starting with the investigator extracting the artifacts from the original media and then staging and organizing them on CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.",

Applications and processes in the sandbox are not able to make permanent changes to the system and its files.\n\nSome malware attempts to delay or stall code execution, allowing the sandbox to time out. A sandbox can use hooks and environmental checks to detect malware. These methods do not prevent many types of malware. For this reason, third-party security services are important.",

Preserving and collecting evidence: Involves making system images, implementing chain of custody documenting the evidence, and recording timestamps. Examining evidence: Characteristics, such as timestamps and identification properties, should be determined and documented. After the evidence has been fully analyzed using scientific methods, the full incident should be reconstructed and documented. Present findings The evidence must be presented as evidence in court. In most cases when presenting evidence in court, it is best to present the findings in a format the audience can understand. Decision: The guilt or innocence of the accused party is determined.",

Clustering: The process of providing failover capabilities for servers by using multiple servers together. A cluster consists of several servers providing the same services. If one server in the cluster fails, the other servers will continue to operate. Cold site: For disaster recovery includes a basic room with raised flooring, electrical wiring, air conditioning, and telecommunications lines. To properly test disaster recovery procedures at the cold site, alternative telecommunications and computer equipment would need to be set up and configured. Server redundancy: Ensures that each server has another server that can operate in its place should the original server fail. Clustering is a form of server redundancy. Warm site: A leased facility that contains electrical and communications wiring, full utilities, and networking equipment. In most cases, the only devices that are not included in a warm site are the computers. Hot site: A leased facility that contains all the resources needed for full operation.",

Preserving and collecting evidence: Involves making system images, implementing chain of custody documenting the evidence, and recording timestamps. Examining evidence: Characteristics, such as timestamps and identification properties, should be determined and documented. After the evidence has been fully analyzed using scientific methods, the full incident should be reconstructed and documented. Present findings The evidence must be presented as evidence in court. In most cases when presenting evidence in court, it is best to present the findings in a format the audience can understand. Decision: The guilt or innocence of the accused party is determined.",

It sends a beam of light across the area, and if the beam is interrupted (by a person, for example) the alarm is triggered. Acoustical systems: Detection systems that use strategically placed microphones to detect any sound made during a forced entry. Wave Motion Detectors: These devices generate a wave pattern in the area and detect any motion that disturbs the excepted wave pattern. When the pattern is disturbed, an alarm sounds.

        "explanation":  "At the beginning of any investigation, you should ask the questions who, what, when, where, and how. These questions can help you get all the data needed for the chain of custody. The chain of custody shows who controlled the evidence, who secured the evidence, and who obtained the evidence. A proper chain of custody must be preserved to successfully prosecute a suspect. To preserve a proper chain of custody, you must collect the evidence following predefined procedures in accordance with all laws and regulations.\nChain of custody forms should be used to track who has access to the evidence, when that access occurs, and other valuable details based on the organization\u0026rsquo;s or investigation\u0026rsquo;s needs. This chain of custody form should be kept with the evidence at all times. For example, if a forensic investigator plans to analyze the contents of a digital log, that investigator should complete the appropriate information on the chain of custody form to indicate when a copy of the digital log was obtained, the type of analysis being performed, and other details.\nThe primary purpose of the chain of custody is to ensure that evidence is admissible in court. Law enforcement officers emphasize chain of custody in any investigations that they conduct. Involving law enforcement early in the process during an investigation can help to ensure that the proper chain of custody is followed.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "The redundancy methods are defined as follows: RAID 0: Also called disk striping, this method writes the data across multiple drives, but although it improves performance, it does not provide fault tolerance. RAID 1: Also called disk mirroring, it uses two disks and writes a copy of the data to both disks, providing fault tolerance in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 2: In this system the data is striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level. RAID 3: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping and then parity information is written to a single dedicated drive; the parity information is used to regenerate the data in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 5: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is also distributed across all drives. RAID 7: Although not a standard but a proprietary implementation, this system incorporates the same principles as RAID 5 but enables the drive array to continue to operate if any disk or any path to any disk fails. The multiple disks in the array operate as a single virtual disk.",

One copy of the image will be stored to ensure that an undamaged, accurate copy is available as evidence. The other copy will be used during the examination and analysis steps.

        "explanation":  "The listed detection systems operate in the following ways: Passive infrared systems (PIR): Detection systems that operate by identifying changes in heat waves in an area. Electromechanical systems: Detection systems that operate by detecting a break in an electrical circuit. For example, the circuit may cross a window or door, and when the window or door is opened, the circuit is broken setting off an alarm of some sort. Photometric system: Or a photoelectric system operates by detecting changes in the light and therefore is used in windowless areas. It sends a beam of light across the area, and if the beam is interrupted (by a person, for example) the alarm is triggered. Acoustical systems: Detection systems that use strategically placed microphones to detect any sound made during a forced entry. Wave Motion Detector: These devices generate a wave pattern in the area and detect any motion that disturbs the expected wave pattern. When the pattern is disturbed, an alarm sounds. Capacitance detector: These devices emit a magnetic field and monitor that field. If the field is disrupted, which occurs when a person enters the area, the alarm sounds.",

The most popular form of egress monitoring is carried out using firewalls that monitor and control outbound traffic. Continuous monitoring and Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) are not specific enough to answer this question. Any logging and monitoring activities should be part of an organizational continuous monitoring program. The continuous monitoring program must be designed to meet the needs of the organization and implemented correctly to ensure that the organization\u0026rsquo;s critical infrastructure is guarded.

Motive is all about why the crime was committed and who committed the crime. Opportunity is all about where and when the crime occurred. Means is all about how the crime was carried out by the suspect. Any suspect who is considered must possess all three of these qualities. For example, a suspect might have a motive for a crime (being dismissed from the organization) and an opportunity for committing the crime (user accounts were not disabled properly) but might not possess the means to carry out the crime.",

        "explanation":  "The listed detection system operate in the following ways: Passive infrared systems (PIR): Detection systems that operate by identifying changes in heat waves in an area. Electromechanical systems: Detection systems that operate by detecting a break in an electrical circuit. For example, the circuit may cross a window or door, and when the window or door is opened, the circuit is broken, setting off an alarm of some sort. Photometric systems: Or photoelectric systems, operate by detecting changes in the light and thus are used in windowless areas. It sends a beam of light across the area, and if the beam is interrupted (by a person, for example) the alarm is triggered. Acoustical systems: Detection systems that use strategically placed microphones to detect any sound made during a forced entry. Wave motion detectors: These devices generate a wave pattern in the area and detect any motion that disturbs the excepted wave pattern. When the pattern is disturbed, an alarm sounds. Capacitance detector: These devices emit a magnetic field and monitor that field. If the field is disrupted, which occurs when a person enters the area, the alarm sounds.",

        "explanation":  "A structured walk-through test is the most accurate. It occurs when representatives of each department or functional area thoroughly review the BCP\u0026rsquo;s accuracy. A simulation test occurs when the operations and support personnel execute the DRP in a role-playing scenario to identify omitted steps and threats. A checklist test occurs when managers of each department or functional area review the BCP and make note of any modifications to the plan for the BCP committee. A table-top exercise is an informal brainstorming session that encourages participation from business leaders and other key employees. In a table-top exercise, the participants agree to a particular disaster scenario upon which they will focus.",

RAID 2: In this system the data is striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level as in RAID 3 and RAID 5. RAID 3: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is written to a single dedicated drive. The parity information is used to regenerate the data in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 5: Requires at least three drives.

Relevant means that it must prove a material fact related to the crime in that it shows a crime has been committed, can provide information describing the crime, can provide information regarding the perpetrator\u0026rsquo;s motives, or can verify what occurred. Legally permissible means that evidence is deemed by the judge to be useful in helping the jury or judge reach a decision and cannot be objected to on the basis that it is irrelevant, immaterial, or violates the rules against hearsay and other objections. Reliability means that it has not been tampered with or modified. Properly identified means that the evidence is labeled appropriately and entered into the evidence log. Preservation means that the evidence is not damaged, modified, or corrupted in anyway.",

        "explanation":  "Virtual assets include software-defined networks, virtual storage-area networks (VSANs), guest operating systems deployed on virtual machines (VMs), and virtual routers. As with physical assets, the deployment and decommissioning of virtual assets should be tightly controlled as part of configuration management because virtual assets, just like physical assets, can be compromised. For example, a Windows 10 VM deployed on a Windows Server system should be retained only until it is no longer needed. As long as the VM is being used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate updates, patches, and security controls are deployed on it as part of configuration management. When users no longer access the VM, it should be removed.",

A cold site does not contain any computers or telecommunications equipment. It does contain wiring, heating and air, and raised flooring. It is much cheaper than a hot site. However, it takes much longer to recover. A warm site contains telecommunications equipment but no computers and is cheaper than a hot site but more expensive than a cold site. It takes longer to recover than a hot site but shorter to recover than a cold site. A hot site contains telecommunications and computers and is the most expensive alternative site. It takes the shortest amount of time to recover. A tertiary site provides an alternate in case the hot site, warm site, or cold site is unavailable.",

Electromechanical systems: Detection systems that operate by detecting a break in an electrical circuit. For example, the circuit may cross a window or door, and when the window or door is opened, the circuit is broken, setting off an alarm of some sort. Photometric systems: Or photoelectric systems, operate by detecting changes in the light and thus are used in windowless areas. It sends a beam of light across the area, and if the beam is interrupted (by a person, for example) the alarm is triggered. Acoustical systems: Detection systems that use strategically placed microphones to detect any sound made during a forced entry. Wave motion detectors: These devices generate a wave pattern in the area and detect any motion that disturbs the excepted wave pattern. When the pattern is disturbed, an alarm sounds. Capacitance detector: These devices emit a magnetic field and monitor that field. If the field is disrupted, which occurs when a person enters the area, the alarm sounds.",

        "explanation":  "Configuration management specifically focuses on bringing order out of the chaos that can occur when multiple engineers and technicians have administrative access to the computers and devices that make the network function. It follows the same basic process as Change Management Processes,\u0026rdquo;, but it can take on even greater importance here, considering the impact that conflicting changes can have (and in some immediately) on a network.\nConfiguration management documents the setup for computers and devices, including operating system and firmware versions. Change management provides the mechanism whereby the configuration can be changed through formal approval. Some standards consider configuration management a subset of change management, whereas others say change management is a subset of configuration management. It is just important to recognize that there is a relationship between the two. Configuration management documents the configuration items (CIs) that can then be changed via the change management process.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "In which RAID method is the data striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level?",
        "explanation":  "The redundancy methods are defined as follows: RAID 0: Also called disk striping, this method writes the data across multiple drives, but although it improves performance, it does not provide fault tolerance. RAID 1: Also called disk mirroring, it uses two disks and writes a copy of the data to both disks, providing fault tolerance in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 2: In this system the data is striped across all drives at the bit level rather than the byte level. RAID 3: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is written to a single dedicated drive. The parity information is used to regenerate the data in the case of a single drive failure. RAID 5: Requires at least three drives. The data is written across all drives like striping, and then parity information is also distributed across all drives. RAID 7: Although not a standard but a proprietary implementation, this system incorporates the same principles as RAID 5 but enables the drive array to continue to operate if any disk or any path to any disk fails. The multiple disks in the array operate as a single virtual disk.",

Separation of duties: The concept that prescribes that sensitive operations be divided among multiple users so that no one user has the rights and access to carry out the operation alone. Job rotation: Refers to training of multiple users to perform the duties of a position to help prevent fraud by any individual employee. Mandatory vacations: Requiring all users to take time off, allowing another to fill their position while gone, which enhances the opportunity to discover unusual activity.",

        "explanation":  "The listed administrative controls address the following concerns: Need to Know/Least Privilege: Concept that users should be given access to only resources required to do their job. Separation of duties: The concept that prescribes that sensitive operations be divided among multiple users so that no one user has the rights and access to carry out the operation alone. Job rotation: Refers to training of multiple users to perform the duties of a position to help prevent fraud by any individual employee. Mandatory vacations: Requiring all users to take time off, allowing another to fill their position while gone, which enhances the opportunity to discover unusual activity.",

Provisional accreditation is given for a specific amount of time and lists required changes to applications, systems, or accreditation documentation. Full accreditation grants accreditation without any required changes. Provisional accreditation becomes full accreditation after all the changes are completed, analyzed, and approved by the certifying body.",

Coupling: Describes how much interaction one module requires from other modules to do its job. Low or loose coupling indicates a module does not need much help from other modules, whereas high coupling indicates the opposite.

        "questionText":  "Which of the following can denote the BEST possible programming technique when used in object oriented programming?",
        "explanation":  "Cohesion is a term used to describe program organization. It is the degree to which elements of a module are related functionally. If it is limited to a small number or a single function, it is said to have high cohesion. High cohesion is good in that changes can be made to the model without affecting other modules. It also makes reusing the module easier. The highest cohesion is provided by limiting the scope of a module\u0026rsquo;s operation.\n\nCoupling\n\nCoupling describes how much interaction one module requires from another module to function the overall programming function. Low or loose coupling indicates that a module does not need much help from other modules, whereas high coupling indicates the opposite. If Module A needs to wait on results from messages it sent to three other modules before it can proceed, it is said to have high coupling. Low coupling, in other words, indicates how independent a class is from other classes. The best programming provides high cohesion and low coupling.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "When an application operates in a client/server framework, as many do, the solution is performing distributed computing. This means that components on different systems must be able to both locate each other and communicate on a network. Typically, the bulk of the solution is on the server, and a smaller piece is located on the client. Therefore, some architecture is required to support this process-to-process communication.",

This was the only type of programming done in the 1950s and uses basic binary instructions without a compiler or interpreter (programs that convert higher language types to a form that can be executed by the processor). This type of programming is both time-consuming and prone to errors. Most of these programs were very rudimentary due to the need to keep a tight rein on their length.",

        "explanation":  "With the Agile model, less time is spent on upfront analysis and more emphasis is placed on learning from the process and incorporating lessons learned in real time. There is also more interaction with the customer throughout the process. In the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model, less time is spent upfront on design, while emphasis is placed on rapidly producing prototypes with the assumption that crucial knowledge can only be gained through trial and error. In contrast to the JAD model, the Cleanroom model strictly adheres to formal steps and a more structured method. It attempts to prevent errors and mistakes through extensive testing. In the modified Waterfall model, each phase in the development process is considered its own milestone in the project management process. Unlimited backward iteration (returning to earlier stages to address problems) is not allowed in this model.",

        "explanation":  "Cohesion\n\nCohesion is a term used to describe program organization. It is the degree to which elements of a module are related functionally. If it is limited to a small number or a single function, it is said to have high cohesion. High cohesion is good in that changes can be made to the model without affecting other modules. It also makes reusing the module easier. The highest cohesion is provided by limiting the scope of a module\u0026rsquo;s operation.\n\nCoupling\n\nCoupling describes how much interaction one module requires from another module to function the overall programming function. Low or loose coupling indicates that a module does not need much help from other modules, whereas high coupling indicates the opposite. If Module A needs to wait on results from messages it sent to three other modules before it can proceed, it is said to have high coupling. Low coupling, in other words, indicates how independent a class is from other classes. The best programming provides high cohesion and low coupling.",

Cohesion: A term used to describe how many different tasks a module can carry out. If it is limited to a small number or a single function, it is said to have high cohesion. Coupling: Describes how much interaction one module requires from another module to do its job. Low or loose coupling indicates a module does not need much help from other modules, whereas high coupling indicates the opposite. Data structure: Refers to the logical relationship between elements of data. It describes the extent to which elements, methods of access, and processing alternatives are associated and the organization of data elements.",

After it\u0026rsquo;s installed, the bot can connect back to the hacker\u0026rsquo;s computer. After a connection is successfully established, the hacker\u0026rsquo;s server controls all the bots located on these machines. At a set time, the hacker might direct the bots to take some action, such as direct all the machines to send out spam messages, initiate a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, send phishing emails, or do any number of malicious acts. The collection of computers that act together is called a botnet, and the individual computers are called zombies. The attacker\u0026rsquo;s computer that manages the botnet is often referred to as the bot herder or bot master.",

Coupling: Describes how much interaction one module requires from other module to do its job. Low or loose coupling indicates a module does not need much help from other modules, whereas high coupling indicates the opposite. Data structure: Refers to the logical relationship between elements of data. It describes the extent to which elements, methods of access, and processing alternatives are associated and the organization of data elements.",

        "explanation":  "Buffer Overflow\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, a buffer is an area of memory where commands and data are placed until they can be processed by the CPU. A buffer overflow occurs when too much data is accepted as input to a specific process. Hackers can take advantage of this phenomenon by submitting too much data, which can cause an error or, in some cases, execute commands on the machine if the hackers can locate an area where commands can be executed. Not all attacks are designed to execute commands. Some just lock up the computer and are used as DoS attacks.\n\nA packet containing a long string of no-operation instructions (NOPs) followed by a command is usually indicative of a type of buffer overflow attack called an NOP slide. The purpose is to get the CPU to locate where a command can be executed. \n\nIn many cases, the key to preventing buffer overflow attacks is input validation. This method requires that any input be checked for format and length before it is used. Buffer overflows and boundary errors (when input exceeds the boundaries allotted for the input) are considered to be a family of error conditions called input validation errors.\n\nMalformed input is the category in which all buffer overflow attacks fit. Malformed input is any attack in which the input is configured in an unusual way.",

Race condition: Causing processes to execute in a different order to affect the result. Emanations capturing: Eavesdropping on wave frequencies to capture traffic. Maintenance hooks: Backdoors in applications that are designed by the application developers to perform maintenance tasks, which can enable code to be executed without the usual security checks.

        "explanation":  "Software development security covers all the security issues and controls that security professionals must understand when dealing with commercial or in-house-developed software. They should understand the software development lifecycle and be able to assess software security effectiveness and the impact of software.\nSoftware is at the heart of all functionality in computer systems. Various types of software, including operating systems, applications, and utilities, work together to deliver instructions from a human to hardware. All these instructions are created with the intent of making some operation possible.\nWhen software is written and developed, the focus can be placed on its functionality and ease of use or on its security. In many cases, the two goals might work at cross purposes. Giving inadequate attention to the security of a piece of software results in software that can introduce security issues to both the application and the systems on which it is run.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "In an object-oriented system, polymorphism denotes objects of many different classes that are related by some common superclass; thus, any object denoted by this name can respond to some common set of operations in a different way.

For example, three objects can be created to receive the string \u0026ldquo;Toyota Corolla\u0026rdquo; as input. One object\u0026rsquo;s output might be \u0026ldquo;subcompact\u0026rdquo;, another\u0026rsquo;s might be \u0026ldquo;uses regular fuel\u0026rdquo;, and another\u0026rsquo;s might be \u0026ldquo;costs 18,000\u0026rdquo;.

        "explanation":  "In the Test/Validate phase, several types of testing should occur, including ways to identify both functional errors and security issues. The auditing method that assesses the extent of the system testing and identifies specific program logic that has not been tested is called the test data method. This method tests not only expected or valid input but also invalid and unexpected values to assess the behavior of the software in both instances. An active attempt should be made to attack the software, including attempts at buffer overflows and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Some goals of testing performed at this time are\nVerification testing: Determines whether the original design specifications have been met.\nValidation testing: Takes a higher-level view and determines whether the original purpose of the software has been achieved.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "The listed terms are defined as follows: Rootkit: A set of tools that a hacker can use on a computer after he has managed to gain access and elevate his privileges to administrator. Buffer Overflow: Occurs when too much data is accepted as input to a specific process. Hackers can take advantage of this phenomenon by submitting too much data, which can cause an error or in some cases execute commands on the machine if he can locate an area where commands can be executed. Privilege Escalation: The process of exploiting a bug or weakness in an operating system to allow a user to receive privileges to which they are not entitled. Backdoor: A piece of software installed by a hacker that allows them to return later and connect to the computer without going through the normal authentication process.",

        "questionText":  "Which of the following correctly defines the line between the trusted parts of the system and the parts that are untrusted?",
        "explanation":  "In 1972, the U.S. government commissioned the Computer Security Technology Planning Study to outline the basic and foundational security requirements of systems purchased by the government. This study eventually led to the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria, or Orange Book (discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, \u0026ldquo;Security Architecture and Engineering\u0026rdquo;). This section defines some of the core tenets in the Orange Book:\n\n\n\tTrusted computer base (TCB): The TCB comprises the components (hardware, firmware, and/or software) that are trusted to enforce the security policy of the system and that, if compromised, jeopardize the security properties of the entire system. The reference monitor is a primary component of the TCB. This term is derived from the Orange Book. All changes to the TCB should be audited and controlled, which is an example of a configuration management control.\n\tSecurity perimeter: This is the dividing line between the trusted parts of the system and the parts that are untrusted. According to security design best practices, components that lie within this boundary (which means they lie within the TCB) should never permit untrusted components to access critical resources in an insecure manner.\n\tReference monitor: A reference monitor is a system component that enforces access controls on an object. It is an access control concept that refers to an abstract machine that mediates all accesses to objects by subjects. It was introduced for circumventing difficulties in classic approaches to computer security by limiting damages produced by malicious programs. The security risk created by a covert channel is that it bypasses the reference monitor functions. The reference monitor should exhibit isolation, completeness, and verifiability.",

        "explanation":  "Software is typically developed in pieces or modules of code that are later assembled to produce the final product. Each module should be tested separately, in a procedure called unit testing. Having development staff carry out this testing is critical, but using a different group of engineers than the ones who wrote the code can ensure that an impartial process occurs. This is a good example of the concept of separation of duties.",

After it\u0026rsquo;s installed, the bot can connect back to the hacker\u0026rsquo;s computer. After a connection is successfully established, the hacker\u0026rsquo;s server controls all the bots located on these machines. At a set time, the hacker might direct the bots to take some action, such as direct all the machines to send out spam messages, initiate a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, send phishing emails, or do any number of malicious acts. The collection of computers that act together is called a botnet, and the individual computers are called zombies. The attacker\u0026rsquo;s computer that manages the botnet is often referred to as the bot herder or bot master.",

        "explanation":  "Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege, and Practice Defense in Depth\n\nEvery software action should execute with the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job. Any elevated permission should be granted for a minimum period of time necessary. This approach reduces the chance that an attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n\nImplement multiple defensive strategies, also known as defense in depth. Doing so ensures that if one layer of defense turns out to be inadequate, another layer of defense can prevent a security flaw from becoming an exploitable vulnerability and/or limit the consequences of a successful exploit.",

        "explanation":  "Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege, and Practice Defense in Depth\n\nEvery software action should execute with the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job. Any elevated permission should be granted for a minimum period of time necessary. This approach reduces the chance that an attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n\nImplement multiple defensive strategies, also known as defense in depth. Doing so ensures that if one layer of defense turns out to be inadequate, another layer of defense can prevent a security flaw from becoming an exploitable vulnerability and/or limit the consequences of a successful exploit.",

This list can aid in ensuring that organizations not only are aware of the latest attack methods and how widespread these attacks are but also can make the proper precautions and care to their web applications to mitigate these attack types.\n\nOWASP\n\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is another group that monitors attacks, specifically web attacks. OWASP maintains a list of top 10 attacks on an ongoing basis. This group also holds regular meetings at chapters throughout the world, providing resources and tools including testing procedures, code review steps, and development guidelines.\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "To provide software assurance for apps, organizations should develop security requirements that specify, for example, how data used by an app should be secured, the environment in which an app will be deployed, and the acceptable level of risk for an app. To help ensure that an app conforms to such requirements, a process for evaluating the security of apps should be performed. This process is referred to as an app vetting process. An app vetting process is a sequence of activities that aims to determine whether an app conforms to the organization\u0026rsquo;s security requirements. This process is performed on an app after the app has been developed and released for distribution but prior to its deployment on an organization\u0026rsquo;s mobile device. Thus, an app vetting process is distinguished from software assurance processes that may occur during the software development lifecycle of an app. Note that an app vetting process typically involves analysis of an app\u0026rsquo;s compiled, binary representation but can also involve analysis of the app\u0026rsquo;s source code if it is available.",

        "explanation":  "Buffer Overflow\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, a buffer is an area of memory where commands and data are placed until they can be processed by the CPU. A buffer overflow occurs when too much data is accepted as input to a specific process. Hackers can take advantage of this phenomenon by submitting too much data, which can cause an error or, in some cases, execute commands on the machine if the hackers can locate an area where commands can be executed. Not all attacks are designed to execute commands. Some just lock up the computer and are used as DoS attacks.\n\nA packet containing a long string of no-operation instructions (NOPs) followed by a command is usually indicative of a type of buffer overflow attack called an NOP slide. The purpose is to get the CPU to locate where a command can be executed. \n\nIn many cases, the key to preventing buffer overflow attacks is input validation. This method requires that any input be checked for format and length before it is used. Buffer overflows and boundary errors (when input exceeds the boundaries allotted for the input) are considered to be a family of error conditions called input validation errors.\n\nMalformed input is the category in which all buffer overflow attacks fit. Malformed input is any attack in which the input is configured in an unusual way.",
