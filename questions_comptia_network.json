Common data formats such as JPEG (for images) and ASCII (for text) are handled at this layer. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol operates at this layer, providing encryption to secure data transmission.",

The presentation layer converts data from the application layer into a format that can be sent over the network. The session layer synchronizes the data exchange between applications on separate devices. The network layer provides mechanisms for the routing of data between devices across single or multiple network segments.",

        "explanation":  "1000BASE-T requires a minimum of Category 5e UTP cable. RG-59 is a type of coaxial cable with a maximum speed of 10 Mbps. Category 5 UTP cable is not intended for use on a 1000BASE-T network; it will support 10/100 but was superseded by 5e for Gigabit Ethernet. Multimode fiber is used in fiber-optic networks. The 1000BASE-T standard defines 1000 Mbps networking using UTP cable.",
