        "explanation":  "Data loss prevention (DLP) is the ability to detect any sensitive emails, documents, or information leaving your organization; hence, the target state is data in use. Several products in the industry inspect for traffic to prevent data loss in an organization. Some of these can be host-based, whereas others are network-based. Protection of data in motion is attained by using encryption and confidentially protocols\u0026mdash;for example, IPsec or SSH. Protection of data at rest is considered to be a storage solution\u0026mdash;for example, BitLocker. Data in archives is another example of data at rest.",

The Agile methodology begins with end customers describing how the final product will be used and clearly articulating what problem it will solve. Once the coding begins, the respective teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. This process may allow the final deliverable to change to better fit the customer\u0026rsquo;s needs. In an Agile environment, continuous collaboration is key. Clear and ongoing communication among team members and project stakeholders allows for fully informed decisions to be made.",

        "explanation":  "With cloud computing, many of the costs associated with an on-premises data center are shifted to the service provider. Instead of thinking about physical hardware and data center costs, cloud computing has a different set of costs. For accounting purposes, all these costs are operational expenses or operational expenditures (OpEx). OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There\u0026rsquo;s no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it. Moving from a CapEx to an OpEx expenditure model in cloud provides for a good business use case.",

        "explanation":  "DevOps is composed of many technical, project management, and management movements. Before DevOps, there were a few development methodologies. One of the original development methodologies is called the waterfall model. The waterfall model is a software and hardware development and project management methodology that has at least five to seven phases that follow in strict linear order. Each phase cannot start until the previous phase has been completed.\n\n\tOne of the main reasons that organizations have used the waterfall model is that project requirements are agreed upon from the beginning; subsequently, planning and scheduling are simple and clear. With a fully laid-out project schedule, an accurate estimate can be given, including development project cost, resources, and deadlines. Another reason is that measuring progress is easy as you move through the phases and hit the different milestones. Your customers are not perpetually adding new requirements to the project, thus delaying production.",

        "explanation":  "DDoS attacks can be launched in a variety of ways\u0026mdash;directed, reflected, and amplified. A directed DDoS attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system. A reflected DDoS attack involves sending forged requests of some type to a large number of computers that will reply to the requests. Amplified DDoS attacks (a variant of reflected attacks) are used to magnify the bandwidth that is sent to a victim by responding to a query with a message of over 4000 bytes, typically done through publicly accessible DNS servers that are used to cause congestion on the target system using DNS response traffic.",

        "explanation":  "In a spoofing attack, the attacker fakes (spoofs) the source addresses such as the IP address (layer 3) or the mac-address (layer 2) and assumes the role of a legit party on the network. ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious subject/actor (attacker) sends falsified ARP messages over a LAN. This results in the linking of an attacker\u0026rsquo;s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker\u0026rsquo;s MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker begins receiving any data intended for that IP address. ARP spoofing can enable malicious parties to intercept, modify, or even stop data in transit. ARP spoofing attacks can occur only on local-area networks that utilize the Address Resolution Protocol.",

UDP is often used as the transport mechanism because it is more easily spoofed due to the lack of a three-way handshake. For example, if the attacker (A) decides he wants to attack a victim (V), he will send packets (for example, Network Time Protocol [NTP] requests) to a source (S) that thinks these packets are legitimate. The source then responds to the NTP requests by sending the responses to the victim, who was never expecting these NTP packets from the source.",

        "explanation":  "Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can be used to create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys. ECC generates keys through the properties of the elliptic curve equation instead of the traditional method of generation as the product of very large prime numbers. The technology can be used in conjunction with most public key encryption methods, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman. ECC replaces RSA signatures with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and replaces the DH key exchange with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). ECDSA is an elliptic curve variant of the DSA algorithm, which has been a standard since 1994. The new key exchange uses DH with P-256 and P-384 curves.",

        "explanation":  "The certificate revocation list (CRL) is the means for the CA to let others know whether a certificate or a number of certificates become invalid and need to be revoked. To check whether a certificate is revoked, the client must download the list (or have a recent copy of the list) and then look up the serial number of the current certificate in the list. The location of the CRL for a specific certificate (i.e., where to download) is specified in the certificate itself as the CRL distribution point (CDP). Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) instead checks only a specific certificate and asks the OCSP responder whether this certificate was revoked. The OCSP responder quickly returns this specific information (which is again directly or indirectly signed by the issuer of the certificate), hence automating the process in the background as it carries out real-time validation of a certificate and reports back to the user.",

OCSP is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate. OCSP was created as an alternative to certificate revocation lists (CRL) because the latter take a longer time to be fully disseminated, primarily because of the information and data to be parsed compared to OCSP. This is possible because OCSP checks only a specific certificate and asks the OCSP responder whether this certificate was revoked. The OCSP responder quickly returns this specific information, which is again directly or indirectly signed by the issuer of the certificate.",

        "explanation":  "IKEv2 has a simple exchange of two message pairs for the CHILD_SA. IKEv1 uses an exchange of at least three message pairs for Phase 2. In short, IKEv2 has been designed to be more efficient than IKEv1 because fewer packets are exchanged and less bandwidth is needed compared to IKEv1. IKEv2 supports the use of next-generation encryption protocols and anti-DoS capabilities.",

        "questionText":  "Which mode is used in negotiating Phase 1 SA, as illustrated in the following figure?",
        "explanation":  "You can establish a Phase 1 SA in main mode or aggressive mode. In main mode, the IPsec peers complete a six-packet exchange in three round trips to negotiate the ISAKMP SA, whereas aggressive mode completes the SA negotiation in three packet exchanges. Main mode provides identity protection if preshared keys are used. Aggressive mode offers identity protection only if digital certificates are employed.\n\n\tIn this figure, two Cisco FTD devices are configured to terminate a site-to-site VPN tunnel between them. The Cisco FTD labeled as FTD-1 is the initiator, and FTD -2 is the responder. The following steps are illustrated in the figure:\n\n\t\n\t\tFTD-1 (the initiator) has two ISAKMP proposals configured. In the first packet, FTD-1 sends its configured proposals to FTD-2.\n\t\n\t\tFTD-2 evaluates the received proposal. Because it has a proposal that matches the offer of the initiator, FTD-2 sends the accepted proposal back to FTD-1 in the second packet.\n\t\n\t\tThe Diffie-Hellman exchange and calculation process is started. Diffie-Hellman is a key agreement protocol that enables two users or devices to authenticate each other\u0026rsquo;s preshared keys without actually sending the keys over the unsecured medium. FTD-1 sends the Key Exchange (KE) payload and a randomly generated value called a nonce.\n\t\n\t\tFTD-2 receives the information and reverses the equation, using the proposed Diffie-Hellman group/exchange to generate the SKEYID. The SKEYID is a string derived from secret material that is known only to the active participants in the exchange.\n\t\n\t\tFTD-1 sends its identity information. The fifth packet is encrypted with the keying material derived from the SKEYID. The asterisk in Figure 6-3 is used to illustrate that this packet is encrypted.\n\t\n\t\tFTD-2 validates the identity of FTD-1, and FTD-2 sends its own identity information to FTD-1. This packet is also encrypted",

A security association is a relationship between two or more entities that describes how the entities will use security services to communicate securely.

In phase 1, IKE creates an authenticated, secure channel between the two IKE peers, called the IKE Security Association. In phase 2, IKE negotiates the IPsec security associations and generates the required key material for IPsec.",

        "explanation":  "Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network. Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a specific method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. The simplest and the original implementation of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p. With the DH key exchange algorithm, two parties can establish a shared secret key that only the two parties know over an insecure communications channel, even without having shared anything beforehand. The shared key is an asymmetric key, susceptible to MITM attacks.",

        "explanation":  "A particular type of GRE encapsulation is multipoint GRE (mGRE). A single static GRE tunnel interface is used as the endpoint for multiple site-to-site tunnels. DMVPN is based on this mode and uses a single interface on each hub as well as on each spoke to terminate all static and dynamic tunnels.\n\n\tAn mGRE interface is basically a GRE tunnel interface that acts as if it is directly connected to a group of remote mGRE interfaces. DMVPN uses mGRE and the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP), acting as a resolution mechanism between a peer\u0026rsquo;s tunnel address (the IP address configured on the peer\u0026rsquo;s mGRE interface) and the mGRE endpoint address on that peer, called the Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) address.",

AH authenticates IP headers and their payloads, with the exception of certain header fields that can be legitimately changed in transit, such as the Time To Live (TTL) field.",

The major benefit of clientless SSL VPNs is that you do not need a client to be installed on your PC. One of the disadvantages is that only TCP-based applications are supported. Applications using other protocols (such as UDP) cannot traverse clientless SSL VPN connections. Clientless SSL VPNs are typically used in kiosks, shared workstations, mobile devices, and when users just want to encrypt web traffic.",

        "explanation":  "Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm is an example of a cryptographic hash function. The result of the hash is a fixed-length small string of data and is sometimes referred to as the digest, message digest, or simply the hash. Most software vendors publish the MD5 hash of the software package. This way the receiver of the software can run the same hash against the software and compare the results against the results the vendor published. If the generated hash matches the hash that was published, the software is intact from an integrity perspective.",

AH-style authentication authenticates the entire IP packet, including the outer IP header, while the ESP authentication mechanism authenticates only the IP datagram portion of the IP packet.

        "explanation":  "The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) that is used by many Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) to convey information about the severity of the vulnerabilities they disclose to their customers. Each vulnerability carries an associated amount of risk with it. One of the most widely adopted standards to calculate the severity of a given vulnerability is the CVSS, which has three components: base, temporal, and environmental scores.",

        "explanation":  "The Cisco Unified Access validated design offers an end-to-end architecture for implementing BYOD within an organization. Here are the main components of the BYOD architecture:\n\n\t\n\t\tMobile devices: These can be any corporate-owned or personally owned mobile devices that require access to corporate resources. Examples are laptops, smartphones, and tablets.\n\t\n\t\tWireless access points (APs): Cisco wireless APs provide wireless connectivity to the corporate network.\n\t\n\t\tWireless LAN (WLAN) controllers: Cisco WLAN controllers (WLCs) serve as a centralized point for the configuration, management, and monitoring of the Cisco WLAN solution. These are also used to enforce authorization policies to the endpoints that require access.\n\t\n\t\tIdentity Services Engine (ISE): The Cisco ISE is the critical component of a BYOD solution and provides identity management and profiling services, including authentication, authorization, accounting, and access controls.\n\t\n\t\tCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client: The software installed on the mobile device that provides client-side authentication and authorization services by using 802.1x when on the premises and enabling VPN access when used outside the premises.\n\t\n\t\tIntegrated Services Routers (ISRs): Cisco ISRs provide Internet access for home offices and branch locations.\n\t\n\t\tImage Aggregation Services Routers (ASRs): Cisco ASRs provide aggregation and Internet gateway functionality for campus networks and function as aggregators for home offices and branches that connect back to the corporate campus.\n\t\n\t\tCloud Web Security (CWS): CWS provides worldwide threat intelligence, advanced threat defense capabilities, and roaming user protection. The Cisco CWS service uses web proxies in the Cisco cloud environment that scan traffic for malware and policy enforcement.\n\t\n\t\tAdaptive Security Appliance (ASA): The Cisco ASA provides all the standard security functions for the BYOD solution at the Internet edge, including VPN servers, next-gen firewall services, and next-gen IPS services",

        "explanation":  "CVSS is composed of three metric groups: base, temporal, and environmental, each consisting of a set of metrics. Out of these three groups, the temporal metric group reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that may change over time but not across user environments. For example, the presence of a simple-to-use exploit kit would increase the CVSS score, while the creation of an official patch would decrease it. An example of a known vulnerability and its CVSS v3 score is represented at the following URL: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2016-0051. The CVE-2016-0051 displays the CVSS score based on base, temporal and environmental metrics for WebDAV Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, and Windows 10 Gold and 1511, where the vulnerability allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application.",

More often this type of pen testing produces very focused results. The black box approach is the opposite of white box, and pen testers do not have any information about the system they are trying to breach. This is more accurate in simulating an external attack. Gray box, in contrast, is halfway between a white box and a black box approach. In this approach, pen testers have some information available, but not all.",

        "explanation":  "The detection and analysis phase is one of the most challenging phases. Although some incidents are easy to detect (for example, a denial-of-service attack), many breaches and attacks are left undetected for weeks or even months. This is why detection may be the most difficult task in incident response. The typical network is full of blind spots where anomalous traffic goes undetected. Implementing analytics and correlation tools is critical to eliminating these network blind spots. As a result, the incident response team must react quickly to analyze and validate each incident. This is done by following a predefined process while documenting each step the analyst takes. During this phase many activities need to be performed, including the following:\n\n\t\n\t\tProfile networks and systems.\n\t\n\t\tUnderstand normal behaviors.\n\t\n\t\tCreate a log retention policy.\n\t\n\t\tPerform event correlation.\n\t\n\t\tMaintain and use a knowledge base of information.\n\t\n\t\tUse Internet search engines for research.\n\t\n\t\tRun packet sniffers to collect additional data.\n\t\n\t\tFilter the data.\n\t\n\t\tSeek assistance from others.\n\t\n\t\tKeep all host clocks synchronized.\n\t\n\t\tKnow the different types of attacks and attack vectors.\n\t\n\t\tDevelop processes and procedures to recognize the signs of an incident.\n\t\n\t\tUnderstand the sources of precursors and indicators.\n\t\n\t\tCreate appropriate incident documentation capabilities and processes.\n\t\n\t\tCreate processes to effectively prioritize security incidents.\n\t\n\t\tCreate processes to effectively communicate incident information (internal and external communications).",

        "explanation":  "Network intrusion detection and prevention (IDP) systems can be configured as IDS or IPS, respectively. An IDS is deployed in Promiscuous mode, whereas an IPS is deployed in Inline mode. In Promiscuous mode, the IDS receives a copy of packets on the network instead of being directly in the packet flow. IDS can raise alarms when a threat or an attack is detected; however, it does not provide in-line prevention capabilities. IPS can perform active monitoring by intercepting traffic in line and stopping the threats before they can reach the intended target. Cisco offers both services as part of its IDP platforms, and it depends on the administrator as to how one or the other is configured.",

        "explanation":  "A regular expression (sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;regex\u0026rdquo;) is a text string for describing a search pattern. In this case, /^[a-z0-9_-]{6,18}$/ is used to match any lowercase letter (a\u0026ndash;z), number (0\u0026ndash;9), an underscore, or a hyphen. The {6,18} makes sure that are at least 6 of those characters, but no more than 18. Finally, we look for the end of the string ($). In this case, anything that has a special character\u0026mdash;for example, !@#$%\u0026mdash;will not be matched because that is not part of regex.\n\n\tThe following are several great resources to learn about regular expressions or regex:\n\n\tMIT\u0026rsquo;s regex cheat sheet: http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/slides/regex-cheatsheet.pdf\n\n\tRegexp security cheat sheet: https://github.com/attackercan/regexp-security-cheatsheet\n\n\tRegular expressions info: www.regular-expressions.info\n\n\tFun regular expression exercises: https://regexcrossword.com",

The incident response process and incident handling activities can be very complex. To establish a successful incident response program, you must dedicate substantial planning and resources. Several industry resources were created to help organizations establish a computer security incident response program and learn how to handle cybersecurity incidents efficiently and effectively. One of the best resources available is NIST Special Publication 800-61, which can be obtained from the following URL:\n\n\thttp://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf\n\n\tAccording to the same document, \u0026ldquo;a computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.\u0026rdquo;",

        "explanation":  "The leading practice for conducting forensic examination is to always analyze from the most volatile to the least volatile object. In the context of the given question, the proper process would be RAM, swap file, hard drive, and DVD. RAM is the most volatile, and upon switching off the PC, everything in volatile memory can be lost. A swap file contains traces and information of programs and applications that would not have been normally in RAM. It can get overwritten if the PC is restarted. The hard drive should not be exposed to writing by the OS because it can overwrite the otherwise accessible (even if deleted) files. Finally, the DVD is the most nonvolatile medium of all previously mentioned. Unless it is physically broken or scratched (or overwritten if it\u0026rsquo;s a rewritable DVD), it is pretty much indestructible.",

A sloppy or nonexistent chain of custody may end up being rejected by a court of law. Essentially, without a chain of custody, the evidence is worthless. To prove chain of custody, a document (that is, a form) is required that details how the evidence was handled every step of the way. Following are the contents of a typical chain of custody form:\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat is the evidence?\n\t\n\t\tHow and where did you get the evidence?\n\t\n\t\tWhen was the evidence collected?\n\t\n\t\tWho has handled the evidence?

        "explanation":  "The swap file/space (otherwise known as just \u0026ldquo;swap\u0026rdquo;) is only accessible and viewable by the operating system itself. The swap file makes sure that the operating system keeps working. A swap file allows the computer\u0026rsquo;s operating system to pretend that there is more RAM than there actually is. The least recently used files in RAM can be \u0026ldquo;swapped out\u0026rdquo; to hard disk until they are needed later so that new files can be \u0026ldquo;swapped in\u0026rdquo; to RAM. Windows, Mac OS X, and other operating systems also use swap or virtual memory. Pretty much everything in RAM has the potential of being stored in swap space at any given time, and hence, it is most important that a forensic examiner has access to and leverages a swap file.",

However, in cyber forensics, what is the original when it comes to digital photography, copier machines, computer storage, and cloud storage? Typically, properly collected system images and appropriate copies of files can be used in court. Corroborating evidence (or corroboration) tends to support a theory or an assumption deduced by some initial evidence. This corroborating evidence confirms the proposition. Indirect or circumstantial evidence relies on an extrapolation to a conclusion of fact (such as fingerprints, DNA evidence, and so on). This is, of course, different from direct evidence. Direct evidence supports the truth of a proclamation without need for any additional evidence or interpretation.

Typically, such fragments of files can only be located and carved out manually\u0026mdash;for example, using a hex editor that can identify file headers, footers, and segments in between. File carving continues to be an important process used in many cases where the recovery of alleged deleted files is required.

        "explanation":  "Evidence in cybersecurity investigations that go to court is used to prove (or disprove) facts that are in dispute, as well as to prove the credibility of disputed facts (in particular, circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence). Digital forensics evidence provides implications and extrapolations that may assist in proving some key fact of the case. Such evidence helps legal teams and the court develop reliable hypotheses or theories as to the committer of the crime (threat actor). The reliability of the evidence is vital to supporting or refuting any hypothesis put forward, including the attribution of threat actors. The term best evidence refers to evidence that can be presented in court in the original form (for example, an exact copy of a hard disk drive). Typically, properly collected system images and appropriate copies of files can be used in court.",

This reduces the likelihood of evidence contamination.",

        "explanation":  "The figure in this scenario represents the order of volatility of the digital evidence. The leading practice for conducting a forensic examination is to always analyze objects from most volatile to least volatile. In the context of the figure, the proper process would be RAM, CPU registers \u0026gt; virtual memory/swap file \u0026gt; hard disk or solid-state drive(s), and backups or printouts. RAM is the most volatile, and upon switching off the PC, everything in volatile memory can be lost. The swap file contains traces of and information about programs and applications that would not have been normally in RAM. It can get overwritten if the PC is restarted. Hard drives should not be exposed to writing by the OS because it can overwrite the otherwise accessible (even if deleted) files. Finally, backups (local or in the cloud) as well as printouts are nonvolatile.",

        "questionText":  "Which of the following tools offers the most comprehensive information for identification of malware?",
        "explanation":  "Packet capture utilities or tools, sometimes referred to as packet analyzers or packet sniffers, are hardware or programs that intercept and log traffic as it passes over a digital network. This happens as a data stream crosses the network while the packet capture tool captures each packet and decodes the packet\u0026rsquo;s raw data elements representing the various fields that can be interpreted to understand its content. These tools, for example, Wireshark, can offer detailed insight to traffic flow within the network and possible malware-related host-to-network or network-to-host traffic patterns/packet insights. Compared to NetFlow, which is Cisco proprietary, a packet capture is available on every device that supports spanning ports or extending traffic streams to the packet analyzer(s). Windows or Linux logs can give detailed information, however, not for every flow to and from the system but about the activities on the system\u0026mdash;for example, file deletion or system access. Syslog can be useful to collect information from various log-enabled sources; however, by itself it cannot offer insight to any malware-related activities.",

        "explanation":  "The syslog protocol, defined in RFC 3164, provides a transport to allow a device to send event notification messages across IP networks to event message collectors, also known as syslog servers. Syslog uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), port 514, for communication by default, although it can be configured to use TCP. Being a connectionless protocol, UDP does not provide acknowledgments. Additionally, at the Application layer, syslog servers do not send acknowledgments back to the sender for receipt of syslog messages. Consequently, the sending device generates syslog messages without knowing whether the syslog server has received the messages.",

        "explanation":  "One of the best ways to understand protocols and become familiar with the ins and outs of the packets traversing your network is to use sniffers, also called packet capture utilities. Packet captures can be used for security event research and analysis. In the context of this question, the packet sniffer was placed as a routine exercise to see the type of traffic flowing through the network and ascertain that there are no traffic pattern anomalies. However, there are many other uses for packet sniffers; in the context of this question, it is being leveraged as a security reconnaissance tool.",

Which of the following tools can be used from a security viewpoint to capture the traffic and provide flow information about a network?",
        "explanation":  ": NetFlow is a Cisco technology that provides comprehensive visibility into all network traffic that traverses a Cisco-supported device. Cisco invented NetFlow and is the leader in IP traffic flow technology. NetFlow was initially created for billing and accounting of network traffic and to measure other IP traffic characteristics such as bandwidth utilization and application performance. NetFlow has also been used as a network-capacity planning tool and to monitor network availability. Many cybersecurity professionals use NetFlow as a network security tool because its reporting capabilities provide nonrepudiation, anomaly detection, and investigative capabilities. As network traffic traverses a NetFlow-enabled device, the device collects traffic flow information and provides a network administrator or security professional detailed information about such flows.",

S/MIME offers security using encryption and authentication through digital certificates. S/MIME supports DES, 3DES, and RC2. PGP provides strong encryption of files, which can be sent via email. Other than emails, PGP is often used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, files, and directories.",

        "explanation":  "Many commercial and free software programs are available to encrypt files in an end-user workstation or mobile device. BitLocker and FileVault are examples of software that can be used for encrypting the user drive for limiting access to only legitimate users. FileVault (native full disk encryption software on MAC) full-disk encryption uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key. BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature included with Windows Vista and later. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. By default, it uses the AES encryption algorithm in cipher block chaining (CBC) or XTS mode with a 128-bit or 256-bit key.",

Application sandboxing is the process of writing files to a sandbox or temporary storage area instead of their normal location\u0026mdash;for example, Windows application executable files. Malware sandboxing is a technique used to isolate malicious code so that it can run in an isolated environment\u0026mdash;for example, malware-embedded files scanned by Cisco AMP. System-based sandboxing focuses on controlling malicious code in a contained and isolated browser environment\u0026mdash;for example, Google Chromium\u0026ndash;based sandboxing. System sandboxing is a derivative of application sandboxing with support for mobile code.",

The logic bomb is designed to wait until you visit a website that requires a user to log in with credentials, such as a banking site or social network. Consequently, this login will trigger the logic bomb to execute the keylogger and capture credentials and send them to the attacker.",

        "explanation":  "The use of Tor makes security monitoring and incident response more difficult because it\u0026rsquo;s hard to attribute and trace back the traffic to the user. Different types of malware are known to use Tor to cover their tracks. This \u0026ldquo;onion routing\u0026rdquo; is accomplished by encrypting the application layer of a communication protocol stack that\u0026rsquo;s nested just like the layers of an onion. The Tor client encrypts the data multiple times and sends it through a network or circuit that includes randomly selected Tor relays. Each of the relays decrypts a layer of the onion to reveal only the next relay so that the remaining encrypted data can be routed on to it. This figure shows the Tor browser. You can see the Tor circuit when the user accessed h4cker.org from the Tor browser. The packets first went to a host in the Netherlands, then to hosts in Norway and Germany, and finally to h4cker.org.",

        "explanation":  "A protocol-level misinterpretation can be executed by abusing the time to live (TTL) of traffic. TTL is a protocol within a packet that limits the lifespan of data in a computer network. This prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely. Abusing TTL works by first sending a short TTL value with the goal of passing the security receiver, assuming it will be dropped by a router later. This dropping occurs after the security device (meaning between the target and the security device), due to the TTL equaling a value of zero before the packet can reach its intended target. The attacker follows up the first packet with a TTL that has too high a value, with the goal of looking like duplicate traffic to the security device so that the security device will ignore it. By having the longer TTL, the packet will make it all the way to the host because now it has a high enough TTL value while being ignored by the network security solutions.",

        "explanation":  "Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication involves a distributed architecture that divides tasks between participant computing peers. In a P2P network, the peers are equally privileged, which is why it\u0026rsquo;s called a \u0026ldquo;peer-to-peer\u0026rdquo; network of nodes. P2P participant computers or nodes reserve a chunk of their resources (such as CPU, memory, disk storage, and network bandwidth) so that other peers or participants can access those resources. This is all done without the need for a centralized server. In P2P networks, each peer can be both a supplier as well as a consumer of resources or data. A good example was the music-sharing application Napster back in the 1990s.",

With overload NAT, a router has only one registered IP address and maps each internal client that needs to communicate with the Internet to a different port from the registered IP address.

        "explanation":  "Resource exhaustion is a type of denial-of-service attack; however, it can also be used to evade detection by security defenses. A simple definition of resource exhaustion is \u0026ldquo;consuming the resources necessary to perform an action.\u0026rdquo; For example, a service can be a website, such as the blog called www.thesecurityblogger.com. The server hosting this website can provide services only to a certain number of systems using digital communication, meaning the server will fail if too many systems access a specific resource at the same time. When it comes to bypassing access-control security, resource exhaustion attacks can consume all processes to force a system to fail open, meaning to permit access to unauthorized systems and networks. This attack can be effective against access-control technologies that administrators typically configure to fail open if a service failure is detected. The same approach could be used to exhaust systems that have tracking capabilities, such as intrusion detection tools or other network sensors, causing a blackout period for an attacker to abuse without being recorded.",

        "explanation":  "NAT can present a challenge when you\u0026rsquo;re performing security monitoring and analyzing logs, NetFlow, and other data because device IP addresses can be seen in the logs as the \u0026ldquo;translated\u0026rdquo; IP address versus the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; IP address. In the case of Port Address Translation (PAT), this could become even more problematic because many different hosts can be translated to a single address, making the correlation almost impossible to achieve.\n\n\tSecurity products, such as the Cisco Stealthwatch system, provide features that can be used to correlate and \u0026ldquo;map\u0026rdquo; translated IP addresses with NetFlow. This feature in the Cisco Stealthwatch system is called NAT stitching. This accelerates incident response tasks and eases continuous security monitoring operations.",

Although NetFlow might not be able to tell you why the situation is bad at first, it can quickly alarm you that something bad is happening so that you can start to investigate the situation, just like miners did when they noticed the canary had died in the coalmine.",

It is challenging for an administrator to identify the LAN Turtle because it sits on a trusted system and does not require an IP address of its own to provide the reverse encrypted tunnel out of the network. This figure shows an example of a LAN Turtle plugged into a server, providing an encrypted tunnel to an attacker\u0026rsquo;s remote server. This would represent a physical attack that leads to a backdoor for external malicious parties to access.",

The idea is to identify a system with higher-level access rights, such as administrator. This is also known as a form of privilege escalation. Other systems with different levels of network access privileges can also be identified to provide more doorways into the network in the event the original breach is closed, to identify systems to leverage for another form or attack, to hide data by using multiple systems as exit points from the network, and so on. This could be accomplished by identifying a vulnerability on the employee\u0026rsquo;s laptop, placing a remote-access tool (RAT) on it, and then remotely connecting to the system to use it to surf inside the trusted network. The pivot occurs when the threat actor first gains access to the employee computer and \u0026ldquo;pivots\u0026rdquo; from that system to another system on the same network to gain further access to the target network.",

This figure shows how ISE would identify user Hannah and limit her access to only specific resources.

        "explanation":  "Industrywide there are two primary methods of security analysis: the deterministic and probabilistic analysis methods. In deterministic analysis, all data used for the analysis is known beforehand. Probabilistic analysis, in contrast, is done assuming the likelihood that something will or has happened, not knowing exactly when or how. In deterministic analysis, the investigator/analyst knows and obtains \u0026ldquo;facts\u0026rdquo; about the incident, breach, affected applications, and so on. Hence, it leads to a more definitive result. In probabilistic analysis, the analysis components suggest a \u0026ldquo;probabilistic answer\u0026rdquo; to the results of the investigation, which is not a definitive result.",

        "explanation":  "It is important that you have a way to interpret common data values into a universal format and have a good data model. A data model is a hierarchically structured mapping of semantic knowledge about one or more data sets. Having a good data model for all your security event data allows you to build an assortment of specialized (and fast) queries of those data sets.\n\n\tTo be able to create an effective data model, you must first understand the sources of security event data in your infrastructure. The image shown in the question illustrates a security information and event management (SIEM) system receiving data from different sources, including IPS devices, firewalls, NetFlow-generating devices, servers, endpoints, and syslogs from infrastructure devices.",

One of the main goals of data normalization is to purge redundant data while maintaining data integrity. There are different types of normalization, depending on levels of increasing complexity. The following three different types of data normalization categories are used in the industry:\n\n\t\n\t\tFirst normal form (1NF)\n\t\n\t\tSecond normal form (2NF)\n\t\n\t\tThird normal form (3NF)\n\n\n\tAn example of data normalization would be the next-generation IPS devices that can perform data normalization in an effective way. They analyze data as a normalized stream instead of as single or combined packets. In terms of data normalization, it is about having the data presented to security devices in one format rather than many, and this has nothing to do with the database normalization process.",

        "explanation":  "Avoiding exploitation tends to be the focus of many security administrators, yet it is the most challenging step of the kill chain to defend against because too many things can be vulnerable to exploitation. Many attacks seen in the wild leverage known vulnerabilities, meaning there usually is a patch to fix them as well as a signature to enable on security devices to prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited. An example is the recent outbreak of the ransomware known as SamSam, which targets a 2007/2010 vulnerability found in JBoss systems. RedHat has released patches for this vulnerability, and security vendors such as Cisco have released signatures (Snort signatures 18794, 24642, 21516, 24342, and 24343), yet if you search Google using the term \u0026ldquo;/status\u0026amp;full=true\u0026rdquo;, you will find thousands of systems that have been or will be compromised by the SamSam ransomware due to this JBoss vulnerability.",

        "explanation":  "Command and control (C2 or CnC) is the phase of the Cyber Kill Chain when the attacker accesses the breached system. Sometimes this is accomplished by listening for a beacon coming from the target, informing the adversary that a command and control (C2) channel is available to access. Sometimes the adversary must manually attempt to connect to the target system using a specific port to test whether the installation of the malicious software was successful. The end result of this phase is providing the adversary \u0026ldquo;hands-on-keyboard\u0026rdquo; access inside the target environment.",

For example, the adversary\u0026rsquo;s goal could be to place the backdoor titled important.exe on a host; however, the malicious software must somehow get to the target and be installed through some form of exploitation. Delivering an attack can follow many steps and leverage a combination of physical, digital, and social methods. Some common delivery methods are communicating over a network to a target, redirecting a target to a malicious source, and placing the payload onto a mobile storage medium such as a USB stick. Sometimes the adversary can just ask the target to install the malicious software using social engineering tactics.",

Reconnaissance is research on a target and typically is the most time-consuming yet most rewarding step of the kill chain. Goals for this phase are to identify targets, associations to the targets, and as much data as possible about each target. The more data that\u0026rsquo;s found provides more options for planning a more effective attack. For example, an adversary\u0026rsquo;s goal may be to breach a network; however, there are many ways this could be accomplished. Knowing as much as possible about the target would help determine the best approach, meaning the easiest, least costly, and lowest risk to being identified. An example would be identifying multiple web-facing servers and uncovering a vulnerable version of software installed on one of the servers, making it the ideal target to exploit.",

By determining and identifying that an attack vector is being leveraged to stage an attack, from reconnaissance to exploit and install, you can help stop the threat in its tracks by taking early (preventive) measures.\n\n\tFor example, early detection could be identifying the website attempting to exploit the host, whereas late detection could be the network IPS identifying an internally breached host system with installed ransomware that\u0026rsquo;s communicating out to a remote server that will initiate the encryption handshake process. Possible actions for identifying this attack earlier in the kill chain could be patching the vulnerability that was exploited and blocking where the attack was delivered using reputation-based security.",

Within the attack graph are activity threats, which are paths the adversary has already taken. Combining the attack and activity data gives the team an activity-attack graph, which is useful for highlighting the attacker\u0026rsquo;s preferences for attacking the victim as well as alternative paths that could be used. This gives the incident response team a way to focus efforts on defending against the adversary, by knowing where to likely expect the attack as well as being aware of other possible risks to the victim.

        "explanation":  "The installation step of the kill chain can simply be seen as an adversary successfully installing the previously developed weapon and being capable of maintaining persistence inside the target system or environment. Sometimes this step is referred to as \u0026ldquo;establishing a foothold,\u0026rdquo; meaning the adversary can now access the network through the newly established communication channel. Examples of backdoors are remote-access tools (RATs), unauthorized VPN sessions (such as an SSH tunnel from a server), and simply having login rights (possibly from stealing the target system\u0026rsquo;s authentication credentials). It is common for an adversary to pivot to other systems and establish similar communication channels to further improve the foothold on the network because any breached system could eventually be patched or leave the network.",

It implies that the adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data. Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business processes can look fine but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries\u0026rsquo; goals. These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.",

        "explanation":  "The following is the high-level threat-hunting process:\n\n\t\n\t\tThreat hunting starts with a trigger based on an anomaly, threat intelligence, or a hypothesis (what could an attacker have done to the organization?). From that moment you should ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do we really need to perform this threat-hunting activity?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What is the scope?\u0026rdquo;\n\t\n\t\tThen you identify the necessary tools and methodologies to conduct the \u0026ldquo;hunt.\u0026rdquo;\n\t\n\t\tOnce the tools and methodologies are identified, you reveal new attack patterns, TTPs, and so on.\n\t\n\t\tYou refine your hunting tactics and enrich using data analytics. Steps 2\u0026ndash;3 can take one cycle or be iterative and involve multiple loops (depending on what you find and what additional data and research needs to be done).\n\t\n\t\tA successful outcome could be that you identify and mitigate the threat. However, you need to recognize that in some cases this may not be the case. Probably you didn\u0026rsquo;t have the necessary tools and capabilities or there was no actual threat. This is why the success of your hunting program depends on the maturity of your capabilities and organization as a whole.",

From that moment, you should ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do we really need to perform this threat-hunting activity?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What is the scope?\u0026rdquo;\n\t\n\t\tThen you identify the necessary tools and methodologies to conduct the hunt.\n\t\n\t\tOnce the tools and methodologies are identified, you reveal new attack patterns, TTPs, and so on.\n\t\n\t\tYou refine your hunting tactics and enrich using data analytics. Steps 2\u0026ndash;3 can take one cycle or be iterative and involve multiple loops (depending on what you find and what additional data and research needs to be done).\n\t\n\t\tA successful outcome could be that you identify and mitigate the threat.

        "explanation":  "No security product or technology in the world can detect and block all security threats in the continuously evolving threat landscape (regardless of the vendor or how expensive it is). This is why many organizations are tasking senior analysts in their Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and their security operations center (SOC) with hunting for threats that may have bypassed any security controls that are in place. This is why threat hunting exists. Threat hunting is the act of proactively and iteratively looking for threats in your organization.",
